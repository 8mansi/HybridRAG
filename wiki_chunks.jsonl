His \"Doge's March\" from his music for The Merchant of Venice was his most enduring piece. Early life and career Rosse was born on the Isle of Jersey . He was a godson of the celebrated actress Lillie Langtry , although she was only thirteen years old when she was given this responsibility. Rosse attended Harrow , a private boarding school in London, and studied music at the Conservatoire in Leipzig, Germany, as well as in Dresden, Brussel and Vienna. While in Leipzig, he shared lodgings with composer Frederick Delius . He began his musical career singing the minor role of Takemine (Sergeant of the Governor's Guard) in the popular musical The Geisha at Daly's Theatre in London. He was eventually promoted to chorus master there and then became a musical director in several other London theaters. He began to compose music by 1895, soon writing suites of incidental music for several stage plays. His \"Doge's March\" for The Merchant of Venice , produced by Arthur Bourchier at the Garrick Theatre in 1905, was popular for many years. He also wrote orchestral suites that were not meant for the theatre, although some were inspired by plays. One of his most popular songs was \"In Passionate Surrender\", a setting of words by Henry Hamilton. Rosse was musical editor for the publishing firm Willocks & Co.

His friend and business manager was Maundy Gregory who often lodged with the couple. Later, the three moved to a house in St. John's Wood called Abbey Lodge. It was later converted into Abbey Road Studios . He wrote one song each for the musicals Sergeant Brue , with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse (1905), and King of Cadonia , with lyrics by Arthur Wimperis (1908). In 1923, he and Edith formally separated. She continued to live in the Abbey Lodge with Gregory, but not in an intimate relationship. On 15 September 1932, Edith died suddenly after refusing Gregory's request for a loan. It is speculated that she was murdered by Gregory, although no charges were ever filed against him. Rosse died in Brighton on 20 June 1940.

Cane guns are sometimes mistaken for similar-looking \" poacher's guns \". These are usually a more portable and more easily concealed version of conventional sporting guns, commonly a single- or double-barreled shotgun , based on the relatively inexpensive Belgian Leclercq action. With this and similar designs, a folding short-barrelled shotgun can be made to fold back until it lies beneath the stock, so that it can be carried under a coat. An alternative form is in effect a very long-barrelled pistol fitted with a detachable, sometimes called \"take-down\", or folding skeleton stock, though any sporting weapon that requires assembly has obvious drawbacks in the field. In purely practical terms, the distinction is that cane guns, far more costly to produce and, generally speaking, an affectation, ostensibly carried by gentlemen who wished, at all times, to be able to take \"targets of opportunity\", were a curio, a talking point, or a concealed offensive weapon, one that might easily escape detection unless closely examined. In addition to gentleman's canes, guns have also been concealed in other common items such as umbrellas and walking sticks . By contrast, a poacher's gun is very obviously a firearm, albeit one easily concealed by those legitimately going about in the countryside unarmed, by those who carried a gun for ad hoc hunting for the pot or for self-defense, as opposed to a far-less-portable, pure-game gun, though these cross into the survival category. Cane guns are now very rare and difficult to find, since most contravene legislation prohibiting carrying concealed weapons, and period examples, where permitted, are, generally speaking, in the hands of private collectors and museums.

Modern, cartridge-type cane guns are usually fitted to fire large, low-pressure handgun cartridges or .410 bore up to 12-gauge shotgun shells , both of which are well-suited in a weapon that is effectively just a barrel with an integrated chamber, manual ejection, a detachable firing mechanism, a rudimentary grip, and in some cases primitive sights. Other types of cane guns have been produced as air weapons, generally using some form of detachable pressurized air reservoir (a pneumatic air weapon ) in the form of a flask, or integrated into the form of a more generously proportioned stick, such as a traditional shillelagh. Some are effectively dart-firing blowpipes , which are far easier to disguise, being little more than a hollow tube. The weapon was used during a bank robbery in the Pizza Bomber Case . According to the ATF , cane guns, sword guns , and umbrella guns are classified as AOW (any other weapons). In fiction Cane guns have an abiding place in spy culture; a famous example appeared in Ian Fleming's 1953 novel Casino Royale , in which James Bond is threatened with one during his contest at the gaming table with Le Chiffre . The cane gun also appears in the made-for-television adaption of the same name in 1954 as well as in the 1999 Bond movie The World Is Not Enough .

Since these events occur every eight years, always in late April or early May, heralding the onset of the rainy season, it is significant that the decoration of the building's facade contains almost 400 Venus glyphs placed in the masks of the rain god Chac, and that there are eight bicephalic serpents above the main entrance; additionally, numerals 8 in bar-and-dot notation appear on two Chac masks at the northern corners of the palace.

It was a common practice in Mesoamerica to build new temple pyramids atop older ones, but here a newer pyramid was built centered slightly to the east of the older pyramid, so that on the west side the temple atop the old pyramid is preserved, with the newer temple above it. The structure is featured in one of the best-known tales of Yucatec Maya folklore, \"el enano del Uxmal\" ( the dwarf of Uxmal ), which is also the basis for the structure's common name. Multiple versions of this tale are recorded. It was popularised after one of these was recounted by John Lloyd Stephens in his influential 1841 book, Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucat\u00e1n . According to Stephens' version, the pyramid was magically built overnight during a series of challenges issued to a dwarf by the gobernador (ruler or king) of Uxmal.

The quadrangle consists of four palaces placed on different levels that surround a courtyard. Of the different buildings that make up this palatial complex, several vault tops have been recovered, they are painted and represent partial calendrical dates from 906 to 907 AD, which is consistent with the Chan Chahk\u2019ahk Nalajaw period of government. The formal entrance, the hierarchy of the structures through the different elevations, and the absence of domestic elements suggest that this space corresponds to a royal palace with administrative and non-residential functions, where the ruling group must have had meetings to collect the tribute, make decisions, and dictate sentences among other activities.

Detail of the \"House of the Turtles\" Modern history of the ruins Lights and Sound nightly show on Nunnery Quadrangle. Sylvanus G. Morley made a map of the site in 1909 which included some previously overlooked buildings. The Mexican government's first project to protect some of the structures from risk of collapse or further decay came in 1927. In 1930 Frans Blom led a Tulane University expedition to the site. They made plaster casts of the fa\u00e7ades of the \"Nunnery Quadrangle\"; using these casts, a replica of the Quadrangle was constructed and displayed at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois . The plaster replicas of the architecture were destroyed following the fair, but some of the plaster casts of Uxmal's monuments are still kept at Tulane's Middle American Research Institute. In 1936 a Mexican government repair and consolidation program was begun under Jos\u00e9 Erosa Peniche. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited on 27 February 1975 for the inauguration of the site's sound & light show. When the presentation reached the point where the sound system played the Maya prayer to Chaac (the Maya rain deity), a sudden torrential downpour occurred.

The biology, distribution and conservation of this species are dealt with in the following paragraphs with a main focus on Australia as it was here it first became protected. Biology The grey nurse shark, Carcharias taurus , also called the ragged-tooth shark, is an elasmobranch and belongs to the odontaspididae (ragged-tooth) shark family. It can easily be recognized by its characteristic conical snout and under hung jaw. Both jaws are laden with sharp, long and pointed teeth. The head is flattened and it has a large and stout body, which ranges up to 3.2 m and may weigh up to 300 kg. The body is grey to grey-brown dorsally and off-white on the belly. The juveniles (young sharks) usually have dark spots on the upper two-thirds of the body. The first and second dorsal fins are of similar size and the caudal fin is asymmetric. Once believed to be a man-eater, it is now known that this shark rarely attacks humans and if it does it is only in defense, or if it is baited. Sharks are the top predators in our oceans, and as such they are important for the marine ecosystems as important regulators of other species. They eat the weak, the old and the dead animals. The grey nurse sharks eat mainly lobsters, crabs, smaller sharks, fish, rays and squid. Grey nurse sharks have an extremely slow life history, which makes them particularly vulnerable to overfishing.

Females have a gestation period of about 9\u201312 months followed by a resting period of roughly a year, so individual females give birth only every second year and produce on average fewer than one pup per year. Age-at-maturity is also late, at about 6\u20137 years for males and 9\u201310 years for females, giving the species one of the lowest intrinsic rates of population increase recorded for any shark. Distribution Grey nurse sharks live near the coast in sub-tropical to cool-temperate waters near most continental land masses (not found in the eastern Pacific Ocean off North and South America). They have a preference for some places resulting in an uneven distribution. For example, there are few grey nurse sharks found in north Australia while they are relatively abundant in the southern part of the eastern and western Australian waters. They are usually found swimming slowly, just above the sea floor, in sandy-bottomed gutters or in rocky underwater caves near inshore rocky reefs and islands. They can be found at depths ranging from 10 m (near the coastline) to 200 m (on the continental shelf). They are generally solitary but at times small schools of grey nurse sharks are found swimming and feeding together. Conservation status in Australia The grey nurse shark is regarded as one of the most threatened large shark species and was among the first sharks to receive legal protection. Targeted killing due to its fearsome appearance, together with by-catch in commercial fisheries and shark-control programmes, led to steep declines in abundance along the Australian east coast during the mid-20th century. It was first given legal protection in New South Wales coastal waters in 1984, and has since been protected nationally. The species is now assessed globally as Critically End", "source_type": "fixed"}

It was first given legal protection in New South Wales coastal waters in 1984, and has since been protected nationally. The species is now assessed globally as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, reflecting its fragmented distribution, very low reproductive rate and continuing declines in several parts of its range. Within Australia, genetic and movement data support the recognition of two largely separate populations: an eastern population in Queensland and New South Wales waters, and a western population centred off Western Australia. Under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) the east coast population of grey nurse shark is listed as Critically Endangered , while the west coast population is listed as Vulnerable . The species is also protected under state and territory legislation: for example, the east coast population is listed as Critically Endangered under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act 1994, and as a threatened species under corresponding legislation in Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Current status The population of grey nurse sharks in eastern Australia declined sharply through the 1960s and 1970s as a result of targeted spearfishing, game fishing and shark-control programmes, and was already considered depleted by the time full legal protection was introduced in the late 1990s. Early mark\u2013recapture and genetic studies suggested that the total eastern Australian population was likely to be in the low thousands and that the effective breeding population was considerably smaller. More recent close-kin mark-recapture analyses indicate that the adult eastern population remains small but may now be slowly increasing. A 2018 assessment estimated around 2,000 adult sharks with an annual growth rate of about 3\u20134%, and an updated analysis using refined ageing methods estimated an adult abundance of about 1,400 individuals in 2023 (95% confidence interval approximately 900\u20131,900 adults) with an annual growth", "source_type": "fixed"}

These results suggest that existing protection and habitat-based management are preventing further decline, but the population remains at a low absolute size and is still considered at high risk of extinction. Causes for decline Every year, millions of sharks are killed by driftnets, by-catch , revenge actions, beach protective shark meshing, commercial-, recreational- and spear-fishing. The main risk is from by-catch of indirect methods of line fishing and particularly bottom-set commercial fishing lines targeting wobbegong sharks. The grey nurse shark is particularly vulnerable to these pressures because of its very slow life history. Individuals grow slowly and do not reach sexual maturity until about six to seven years of age for males and nine to ten years for females, and females follow a biennial reproductive cycle in which a maximum of two pups are produced after a 9\u201312 month gestation. This combination of late maturity and very low fecundity means that even small increases in fishing mortality or incidental capture can cause long-term population decline. Furthermore, the species has a limited number of preferred aggregation sites and specific habitat requirements, which restrict opportunities for recolonisation of depleted areas. Conservation efforts In Australia, conservation management for grey nurse sharks has focused on both legal protection and habitat-based measures. A series of key aggregation sites along the New South Wales and Queensland coasts (including Fish Rock, Green Island, Julian Rocks, Magic Point and Wolf Rock) have been identified as critical habitat and afforded special protection under state and Commonwealth legislation. At many of these sites, fishing is restricted or prohibited, and there are codes of conduct for divers aimed at minimising disturbance and reducing the risk of hook and line injuries to sharks that aggregate in gutters and caves.", "source_type": "fixed"}

At many of these sites, fishing is restricted or prohibited, and there are codes of conduct for divers aimed at minimising disturbance and reducing the risk of hook and line injuries to sharks that aggregate in gutters and caves. These measures are complemented by a national recovery plan under the EPBC Act, which sets objectives for monitoring population trends and mitigating key threats such as incidental capture in commercial and recreational fisheries. The increased public awareness has led to the development of methods that reduce the unintentional killing of elasmobranch (sharks and rays), turtles and marine mammals. An inexpensive method to reduce by-catch is by using tunnel excluders. These enable sharks, turtles and rays to escape and survive. A prototype used by the Dutch achieved a 40-100% reduction of the by-catch of the most vulnerable species. The size and texture of nets are also of great importance for the survival of larger vulnerable species. Often smaller nets have been shown to catch the same amount of target fish and reduce the by-catch greatly, especially of the mature sharks. Foundation of protected marine areas is particularly valuable for protecting sharks and a new method, taggingCSIRO, can reveal their preferred forage and breeding areas. A good example of managed marine areas is to be found in Jervis Bay, NSW. Jervis Bay has been divided into time zones, some for fishing and some for diving, and the strategy has been approved by both fishermen and divers. However, \u201cDivers that regularly dive at places like South West Rocks in New South Wales will tell you that up to 70 per cent of the sharks there are trailing hooks from line fishing.\u201d says Nicola Beynon from the Humane Society International (HSI).

Feeding and touching of marine animals should be strictly discouraged since it can alter their behaviour, and result in long lasting and severe stress to the animals. Divers have noticed sharks altering their behaviour due to increased hierarchy behaviour around killing areas. The lowest in the hierarchy become stressed and exhibit unpredictable behaviour, which could result in attacks on humans. References Further reading Barker, N. H. L.; Roberts, C.M.

One of the greatest hurdlers ever, he ran during what is considered a golden period for two-mile hurdlers in the 1970s. Bula was \"a remarkably consistent, versatile and durable jumper\" and was known for his come-from-behind style. At one stage Bula had an unbeaten run of 13 races.

Bula was bought by Captain Bill Edwards-Heathcote in Dublin in 1968 for 1,350 guineas, and subsequently put into training with Fred Winter in the summer of 1969. Upon arrival at Winter\u2019s yard, Bula \"looked more like a warhorse than a racehorse\". He was also known for being a bit of a tearaway on the training gallops and was described as \"a lunatic\" by his stable lad Vincent Brooks.

A small to medium-sized bushy tree endemic to the rainforests of tropical Queensland , Australia . It features large leaves with attractive yellow venation, 25 cm (10 in) long by 10 cm (4 in) wide. They are dark green above, and paler and somewhat hairy below. The leaf stalks are hairy. The small (0.7 cm diameter) greenish flowers are fragrant and occur from March to May. They are followed by fruits which mature from September to October, being a black drupe . Regeneration is from fresh seed, after removing the fleshy aril around the seed. The species was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller as Cylicodaphne bindoniana in 1865, before he reclassified and renamed it as Litsea bindoniana in 1882. It was named in honour of Victorian 19th century parliamentarian and agriculturist Samuel Henry Bindon. It is one of eleven species in the large Asian genus Litsea to reach Australia. Litsea bindoniana is found in central and northern Queensland in forests to altitudes of 1000 m (3500 ft). Its fruit are eaten by the superb fruit dove , along with many other lauraceae. It is also a food plant for the blue triangle ( Graphium sarpedon ) and bronze flat ( Netrocoryne repanda ). The leaves are used by the tooth-billed catbird ( Scenopoeetes dentirostris ) to decorate its display court. Litsea bindoniana is suited as a garden plant in tropical situations. Young plants need protection from winds, as well as plenty of shade and moisture.

History Andlau Abbey was founded in or about 880 by Richardis , later Saint Richardis, empress of Charles the Fat , on her ancestral lands. The foundation legend states that the abbey was sited where Richardis saw a she-bear scratching at the soil; a bear is one of her emblems in reference to this. In 887 Richardis was put to the ordeal by fire by her husband on the pretext of adultery with the chancellor Liutward . She survived the ordeal successfully and withdrew to Andlau, where at the time her niece Rotrod was abbess. She died here in about 895 and was buried in the abbey church. The abbey survived the Reformation , thanks to the efforts of the Abbess Rebstock, who is commemorated in the present church, but not the French Revolution .

It is a fungus that infects the bottom 122\u2013152 centimeters (4\u20135 feet) of the plant also rotting the roots . It has been known to be in both natural and planted environments and in the majority of cases only in palms. Symptoms and diagnosis Symptoms of Ganoderma zonatum are general decline in the health of a plant, wilting and discoloration of the leaves and slow growth. However, this is noticeable in many different plant diseases and can not be used as a diagnosis tool. There are only two ways to fully identify G. zonatum . One is the basidiocarp (or conk) forming on the plant with the other viewing the internal rotting of the palm on the inside once it has been cut down. Life cycle The fungus is spread between the plants due to the spores produced in the basidiocarp. The spores land on the soil and germinate. The hyphae then grow over the plant roots and up into the woody trunk . The fungus damages the palm trunk closest to the soil first, expands in diameter and moves up the center of the trunk causing a cone like shape of infected trunk. When the basidiocarp emerges it is at the highest point when the fungus will internally grow. Growing on a sabal palm in Manatee County , Florida Protecting plants There is currently no method for the control of G. zonatum once it has been identified. However minimizing the amount of moisture can decrease the risk of a palm becoming infected by the fungus. In places where a palm has been infected with G. zonatum , no other palm should be planted as the spores can survive in the soil. Some other prevention methods include: Avoiding injury to the trunks of palm trees. Being careful when using lawnmowers and other gardening equipment. Consulting forestry", "source_type": "fixed"}

Official results, announced on 27 October, gave Law and Justice 235 of the 460 seats, a majority of four. PiS vice chairwoman Beata Szyd\u0142o succeeded PO leader Ewa Kopacz as Prime Minister of Poland , heading a one-party cabinet . It was the first election for a national parliament in Europe since the 1993 Norwegian elections in which the two largest parties were led by a female candidate, and the second election in history (also since the 1993 Norwegian election) where more than three parties fielded female leadership candidates. It was also the first election in Poland since the restoration of full democracy that a party won an absolute majority in the Sejm. Following PiS's victory in the May 2015 presidential elections , PiS would have control over both the presidency and parliament for the next eight years. Electoral system The process of election for the Sejm is through open party-list proportional representation via the D'hondt method in multi-seat constituencies , with a 5% national threshold for single parties and 8% threshold for coalitions (requirements waived for ethnic minorities). The senate is elected using first-past-the-post voting in single-member districts . To be included on a ballot , a senate candidate must present 2,000 signatures of support from their constituents. For Sejm elections, the threshold is 5,000 signatures per constituency, though that requirement is waived for parties that have already registered lists in at least half of all constituencies (21 out of 41 as of this election).

Prior to the announcement of the election date, the most likely dates were thought to be in October or November.

Precursor to and merge with Rails 3 Merb began as a \"clean-room\" implementation of the Rails controller stack but grew to incorporate several ideas that deviated from Rails's spirit and methodology at the time, most notably component modularity , extensible API design, and vertical scalability . It was developed by Ezra Zygmuntowicz and Yehuda Katz. Most of these capabilities were added to Rails during the Rails 3/Merb merger. Merb was first released at the 2008 RubyConf and development has since stopped; Rails 3, therefore, serves as both the successor to Rails 2 and the successor to Merb. Differences from Ruby on Rails Merb's design attempted to address several criticisms of Rails 2: lack of component modularity ( monolithic design) lack of an extensible API lack of vertical scalability Modularity Merb itself encompassed only the controller layer in MVC architecture, and used a suite of complementary, optional plugins together to assemble applications. The primary integration points were the web server interface, the model layer, the view layer, and controller extensions and add-ons. Merb's default application stack incorporated Datamapper for models, ERB for views, and Rack and Mongrel as the web server layer. Well-defined API Before the Merb / Rails 3 merge, Rails lacked a well-defined, documented, public API for extensions and plug-ins, leading to issues when Rails changes broke monkey-patches performed by plug-ins. With the Rails 3 / Merb merge, Rails gained a defined public API with a test suite, giving users and plugin developers a clearer, more stable API to build against, reducing plugin breakage", "source_type": "fixed"}

Then he served in the campaigns against Austria in 1805 and also against Prussia in 1806/07 with the rank of Major .

However, Lieutenant General Von Deroy argued against Seyssel d'Aix's request, stating that his battle activities were more likely to be punished than awarded, if judged in the court of public opinion. Later career Seyssel d'Aix took part in the war of 1812 as an Oberst and commander of the 22nd Light Cavalry Brigade of the Grande Arm\u00e9e .

When the first non-native settlers arrived in the Fishing Creek valley, they created another path that intersected the Indian path, and the community came to be named for the deer antlers. The community was founded due to discovery of ore in the area. Vaniah Rees built the first house in the community in 1820. The first store in the community was opened in 1836.

During World War I , American horsemen were able to purchase well-bred foals from French breeders who could not afford to feed them during the extremely difficult war years. Some were bought directly by breeders, while many were purchased by brokers, who immediately resold them in America at the various thoroughbred auctions. As such, William Woodward Sr. was able to build his broodmare band on French imports. Under William Woodward Sr., the farm produced some of the greatest thoroughbred racehorses in the United States .

He also worked as the editor of The Linotype News , and as a columnist for Publisher's Auxiliary . Early life Arnold was born on June 25, 1913, in Bay City, Michigan , the son of Ferdinand M. and Anna I. (Begick) Arnold. As a small boy the family moved to Saginaw, Michigan. Edmund's only brother, Robert, drowned in the Saginaw Bay in a boating accident in 1938 at the age of 19. Career When World War II broke out, Arnold became an editor for the 70th Infantry Division 's newspaper. After the war, he became a co-owner of the Michigan-based Frankenmuth News during which time his typography interest kicked in. Later on, Arnold became a picture editor of The Saginaw News . In 1954 he moved to New York City where he became an editor of popular Linotype News , an imprint of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company . Later on, he spent 44 years of his life as a newspaper design advocate columnist in a weekly trade journal, The Publishers' Auxiliary which always ended with \"Arnold's Ancient Axiom\".

The cause of death was reported as Respiratory Disease NYTimes.com . Awards In 1957 Arnold, for his contribution to American journalism through typographical design was a recipient of the George Polk Memorial Award. He also was honored with SND's lifetime achievement award in 2000 from the American Press Institute . When describing the state of news design in an interview at the time he was honored, Arnold said: I want to put on record that I'm not an old reprobate longing for a return of the good old days. I'm more of an old father who is disappointed that his kids are only reaching 98 percent of their potential and wants them to reach 101 percent. My message to young designers is this: Look kids, you can do better, but the only way to achieve your potential is to go back to - and understand - the basics. That sounds boring, but it's reality. The seminal work on the Gutenberg diagram ( Z pattern layout ) is attributed to the typographer Edmund Arnold, who is said to have developed the concept in the 1950s.

The club, which competes at county level and in the \"South\" division of Tipperary GAA, is known by its supporters as \"the village\". The team's home ground is on the main Ardfinnan to Clonmel road (the R665 ) just outside the village. The club draws its players and support from the village of Ardfinnan and the neighbouring parishes of Grange and Ballybacon. Ardfinnan club only plays Gaelic football but the area also has a senior hurling club, Ballybacon-Grange GAA , which is based in Goatenbridge village around three miles from Ardfinnan. History Ardfinnan GAA club was formed in 1910. Prior to 1910 local teams had played on the green in Ardfinnan village. At that time the Ardfinnan Woollen Mills had a big influence on the club as many of the players were employed there. Then a junior club, Ardfinnan entered the Tipperary senior championship in 1912 for the first time but were beaten by Fethard . At this time Ardfinnan played in black and white jerseys, and so became known as \"the magpies\". The colours were then changed to green with a white band and white shamrock; that shamrock still remains on the jerseys to this very day. The club played senior in 1917 and 1918 but due to the War of Independence there was very little football played in the period between 1919 and 1922. Ardfinnan reached their first South division final in 1927 but were beaten by a Carrick on Suir side that went on to win the County title. In 1928 Ardf", "source_type": "fixed"}

The 1960s were Ardfinnan's golden era, in which the club won the county senior title three times and the South senior title five times, including four consecutive seasons. In November 2005, Ardfinnan won their first county title since 1974 with a 1\u20135 to 1\u20134 win against Loughmore-Castleiney in Cashel. That title ended a 31-year famine with a late winning point by player manager Peter Lambert . Ardfinnan went on to lose to Nemo Rangers in the 2005 Munster Championship quarter-final on a 0\u20136 to 1\u201313 scoreline in Ardfinnan on 13 November. In November 2011, the club published its official history.

It is found in East Africa . Taxonomy The lichen was formally described as new to science in 2011 by the lichenologists Kumelachew Yeshitela, Eberhard Fischer, Dorothee Killmann, and Emmanu\u00ebl S\u00e9rusiaux . The type specimen was collected by the first author from Budongo Forest at an elevation of 1,000 m (3,300 ft), where it was found growing on the leaves of Argomuellera macrophylla . The species name nigriuncinata alludes to the distinctive hooked structures found on the setae of this species. Description Tricharia nigriuncinata is a leaf-dwelling ( epiphyllous ) lichen that forms a continuous, smooth, and thin thallus that is greyish-green in colour and spans up to 5 mm in width. The lichen is characterised by its abundance of sterile setae, which are black, setiform , and can be simple or adorned with 1 to 6 horizontal or downward-bending hooks near the middle. These setae can reach lengths of up to 1.5 mm and are about 0.04 mm thick at their base. The photobiont of this species is chlorococcoid , comprising spherical green algal cells that measure 5 to 8 \u03bcm in diameter. In terms of reproductive structures, apothecia (fruiting bodies) are typically absent but can occasionally be abundant. When present, these apothecia are sessile and round, measuring 0.1 to 0.2 mm in diameter and approximately 75 \u03bcm in height.

The disc of the apothecia is light orange to almost translucent and opaque, lying flat without any pruina . The margin is thin and either non-prominent or slightly so, smooth, and pale brown, usually darker than the disc. In the structure of the apothecia, the excipulum is gelatinised and prosoplectenchymatous (i.e., its constituent fungal hyphae are all aligned in a particular direction), measuring 20 to 30 \u03bcm in thickness and light brown in colour. The hypothecium is about 10 \u03bcm thick and hyaline (translucent), while the epihymenium is pale brown and 5 to 8 \u03bcm high. The hymenium is clear and measures 40 to 50 \u03bcm in thickness. The paraphyses of the lichen are branched and anastomosing , approximately 1 \u03bcm thick. The asci are broadly clavate (club-shaped) and typically contain 1 to 2 spores, measuring 50 to 65 \u03bcm by 35 to 50 \u03bcm. The ascospores are hyaline (translucent), muriform (divided into numerous compartments by intersecting longitudinal and transverse septa ), ellipsoidal in shape, and measure 40 to 55 \u03bcm by 15 to 25 \u03bcm. Habitat and distribution Tricharia nigriuncinata is predominantly found on leaves in the lower layers of dense, undisturbed rainforests . Its presence is largely restricted to the Albertine Rift , an area in East Africa known for its rich biodiversity . This species is prevalent on the western side of the Rift, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It is a low density semi-rural suburb with larger acreage bushland type blocks. Buccan does not have a formalised town centre or shopping facilities, with its residents relying on Logan Village, Waterford and Beenleigh to access such services. Buccan is home to the Buccan Conservation Park, a nature conservation area managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. Waterford-Tamborine Road (State Route 95) runs through from north to south. History Early European settlers in Buccan were James Williamson and his brother-in-law Mr. A. Fraser who selected land south of Bethania in about 1863. They attempted to grow cotton but had problems with bollworm . However, sugar cane was successfully grown in the district. One of the largest sugar cane plantations in the area was on the land which is Newstead Park today (beside the Logan River). Dairying was also an important farm industry.

Dr. Abraham van der Merwe, then moderator of the Cape Church, described Wynberg in 1954 on the congregation's 125th anniversary as \"the oldest suburban congregation in the Cape Church\"; therefore also in the entire Dutch Reformed Church. The congregation was founded on 20 September 1829 when the first religious service was held under the leadership of the consultant, Dr. Abraham Faure, on the farm De Onder Schuur, later the official residence Westbrooke (since 1995 officially Genadendal), at that time the property of Mr. Egbert Andries Buyskes. This historic residence is currently located within the boundaries of the Dutch Reformed congregation Rondebosch. The first chief justice of the Cape Colony, Sir John Truter, is considered the father and founder of the congregation.

The enlarged church building was demolished in 1897 to make way for the present church building, which was consecrated on 17 March 1899. The first pastor was Rev.

It was built by the nominally independent Eastern Union and Hadleigh Junction Railway company and opened in 1847. By the time of opening it had been taken over by the larger Eastern Union Railway. It was never successful commercially, nor in reviving the fortunes of Hadleigh itself, and passenger services were withdrawn in 1932, followed by total closure in 1965. The northernmost two mile stretch of the trackbed, from the station site in Hadleigh to the site of Raydon Wood Station, now forms the Hadleigh Railway Walk . Unfulfilled schemes The Hadleigh branch in 1853 At the time of the earliest railways, the town of Hadleigh was an important centre of the wool and clothing industry. The Eastern Counties Railway was incorporated in 1836 to build a railway from London to Yarmouth ; the capital was \u00a31.6 million. This was a prodigious project, and in fact the actual cost greatly overran, so that all the money was spent and the railway only reached Colchester . When the ECR reappraised its plans, it proposed to build from Colchester to Bury St Edmunds through Hadleigh, putting Ipswich on a branch from the town, but this scheme came to nothing. Local interests were dismayed that their railway connections was to be denied to them, and in 1844 the Eastern Union Railway was incorporated, to build from Ipswich to Colchester, possibly to include Norwich in its network. However this line was not to connect Hadleigh, and by 1844 merchants in the town had seen the adverse effect on formerly prosperous towns that were by-passed by main lines.

However this line was not to connect Hadleigh, and by 1844 merchants in the town had seen the adverse effect on formerly prosperous towns that were by-passed by main lines. Local people promoted a branch line scheme to connect Hadleigh with Bentley station on the Eastern Union Railway main line, seven miles away. There was intense competition between the Eastern Union Railway and the rival Eastern Counties Railway: the object was to capture as much territory as possible. From the EUR point of view, the Hadleigh branch would cut off the possible advance of the ECR. Accordingly the EUR supported the local scheme, which was nevertheless promoted in Parliament as an independent project. Authorisation and construction The Eastern Union and Hadleigh Junction Railway was incorporated by the Eastern Union and Hadleigh Junction Railway Act 1846 ( 9 & 10 Vict. c. liii) of 18 June 1846; the share capital was to be \u00a375,000. The Eastern Union Railway had opened its main line for goods traffic on 1 June 1846, and passenger operation started on 15 June 1846. The EUR wasted no time in indicating a wish to bring the EU&HJR company into its own control, and the EU&HJR was amenable. When the contract for construction was to be let, the EUR Board were invited to ratify it. The contractor selected was George Wythes. Nevertheless the EU&HJR directors now considered that an extension of their line to Lavenham , an important town in the wool industry, was desirable, and they put in hand the necessary measures to secure parliamentary authorisation for that. In fact the EUR was, at the same time, encouraging the Colchester, Stour Valley, Sudbury and Halstead Railway , which had just received its authorising act of Parliament, the Colchester, Stour Valley, Sudbury and Halstead Railway Act 1846 ( 9 & 10 Vict. c. lxx", "source_type": "fixed"}

At first the local company declined to do so, but they were later persuaded to relent. The act authorising amalgamation of the EU&HJR with the EUR, the Eastern Union and Hadleigh Junction Railway Sale Act 1847 ( 10 & 11 Vict. c. xix), was passed in the following session of Parliament, on 8 June 1847. Opening Hadleigh railway station Confident in the timely completion of the line, the directors arranged a ceremonial opening of the Hadleigh line on 20 August 1847, and the following day the line opened to goods traffic. The Board of Trade inspection, essential for passenger operation, had not taken place, and the line could not yet be opened to passengers. Captain J. L. A. Simmons conducted the inspection on 30 August 1847. Simmons report noted that the junction at Bentley was a triangle so that trains from Ipswich could run direct to the branch. Simmons was satisfied and the line opened fully on 2 September 1847. Five trains ran each way every weekday, with three each way on Sundays, although the Sunday service was withdrawn before long. The profitability of the line was immediately disappointing. In 1848 two direct services to Ipswich were included in the schedule each weekday, but the northern section of the triangular junction to the main line was closed in 1875. From that time, any services to Ipswich reversed at Bentley. Some through coaches to London were run.

Great Eastern Railway The Great Eastern Railway was formed in 1862 by the amalgamation of the Eastern Union Railway, the Eastern Counties Railway and others. The effective date was July 1862. In 1889 there were five passenger trains each way per day on the line, with some working through to Manningtree . Passenger services on the line peaked in 1920 when the number daily had reached seven, but competition from bus services reduced this to five by 1924, which was the level maintained until passenger service was withdrawn. While little changed in the pattern of working on the branch, passenger and goods usage gradually declined in the twentieth century. The conductor-guard system was introduced in the spring of 1922 in an attempt to reduce costs of passenger train working. From 1923 The Railways Act 1921 required most of the railways of Great Britain to be placed under the ownership of one or other of four new large concerns, in a process known as the \"grouping\". The Great Eastern Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER); the transfer is considered to have taken effect from the beginning of 1923. The poor carryings on the line were not overlooked by the LNER, and it was announced that the passenger service on the line would be discontinued after the last train on 27 February 1932; the line was closed to passengers from 29 February 1932. The goods service continued for the time being. Despite the branch line's closure to passengers, private rail tours continued to operate on the goods line.

World War II The goods facilities at Capel and Raydon Wood were used extensively during World War II , handling supplies for a nearby United States Army Air Forces base. The location was later known as RAF Raydon . Closure In peacetime, the goods service on the line once again declined, and was withdrawn after the last clearance of outward traffic on Maundy Thursday , 15 April 1965, closure being considered to have taken place on 19 April 1965. The track was removed later that year. Bentley station lost its passenger service on 7 November 1966. Topography Station list Bentley (station on main line): opened 15 June 1846; closed 7 November 1966. Bentley Church (often called Bentley Church Crossing): open from October 1853 to December 1853. Quick speculates that it was intended as an alternative station for Bentley for trains taking the direct spur to Ipswich. According to the timetable, trains stopped for passengers who had tickets for 8 miles and over, i.e. journeys that involved travel over the main line. That ruled out local use to Hadleigh, even though this stop was far closer to the village than Bentley station itself. Capel: opened 2 September 1847; closed 29 February 1932. Raydon: opened 2 September 1847; renamed Raydon Wood 1895; closed 29 February 1932. Hadleigh: opened 2 September 1847; closed 29 February 1932.

In the dry season, the Boteti is particularly important to provide wildlife an area to congregate, since most seasonal ponds and drainages are then devoid of water. The Boteti flows southeastward out of the Thamalakane River swamp at Toteng , then flows northeastward past Tlkaseoulo, over Ghautsa Falls, and then flows east past the villages of Makalamabedi , Muekekle, and Matima , and then at Kwaraga , it turns south past the villages of Phukumakaku, Khumaga (Lekono), Sukwane, Rakops (Jakops), and Xhuma (Khomo). It then flows past Lake Xau (or in a very wet year into and out of Lake Xau) and then heads east past the village of Mopipi (Madista) and into the Ntwetwe Pan. The Boteti stretches from Ngamiland to the main Boteti District , where it is used to fill the Mopipi Dam, which is important to the many diamond mines of the area, particularly the Orapa diamond mine . The diversion of the river has left many residents without an adequate source of fresh water ; moreover, they could no longer enjoy fishing and other activities in the river.

It was released in the autumn of 1969, on Columbia Records , some eighteen months after its predecessor, Eli and the Thirteenth Confession . It was helmed by her, with the assistance of producer and engineer Roy Halee . The cover photograph was taken by David Gahr . New York Tendaberry is also considered to be the second in a trilogy of classic original Nyro records, with Eli and Christmas and the Beads of Sweat on either side. They are all considered musically and thematically similar, although New York Tendaberry is the most intense and stark. In 1969, Nyro was one of the most popular pop songwriters, and various groups including the 5th Dimension , Three Dog Night , and Blood, Sweat & Tears had enjoyed hits with her compositions. Thanks to the strong word of mouth trailing her work, New York Tendaberry became her most commercially successful record, peaking at No. 32 on the Billboard 200 , formerly known as the Pop Albums chart. The 5th Dimension reached US No. 27 in the Pop Singles chart (the Billboard Hot 100 ) with their version of \" Save the Country \", while artists including Barbra Streisand recorded \"Time and Love\". In 2003, the album was included in Mojo ' s Collection book of the best albums of all time, and the reissued version was voted among the Best Albums of 2002 in Uncut magazine.

Nyro sings of lovers and romances in a notably darker tone than on her previous album Eli and the Thirteenth Confession . Musically, New York Tendaberry is far more intimate than any other Nyro album. Multi-layered instrumentation is less than on previous efforts as some songs were built around her voice and piano, though the use of strings and classical instrumentation is notable. Nyro guided co-producer and engineer Roy Halee using color metaphors. She could not understand musical notation, and used other analogies to communicate what she wanted. The album also uses sound effects such as the gunshot on \"Mercy on Broadway\" and the twinkling sky in \"New York Tendaberry\". Alongside Nyro's piano is a jazz band , an orchestra , and a rock band , though they are used more sparingly than on her previous two releases. The album was released after a year of night-time recording sessions, and is considered by most to be Nyro's artistic highpoint. Reissues The Legacy imprint of Columbia Records reissued the album in remastered and expanded format during the summer of 2002 alongside similar reissues of Eli and the Thirteenth Confession and Gonna Take a Miracle . The reissue featured the previously unreleased song \"In the Country Way,\" recorded by Nyro in 1971; as well as the mono single version of \" Save the Country \", which was recorded in the summer of 1968, in an attempt to give Nyro her first chart hit. This attempt backfired, and she stuck to her solo piano renditions for the New York Tendaberry album.

It is a specialized form of a wave tank . The ripple tank is usually illuminated from above, so that the light shines through the water. Some small ripple tanks fit onto the top of an overhead projector , i.e. they are illuminated from below. The ripples on the water show up as shadows on the screen underneath the tank.

Ripples may be generated by a piece of wood that is suspended above the tank on elastic bands so that it is just touching the surface.

The ripples reflect from the bar. If the bar is placed at an angle to the wavefront the reflected waves can be seen to obey the law of reflection. The angle of incidence and angle of reflection will be the same. If a concave parabolic obstacle is used, a plane wave pulse will converge on a point after reflection. This point is the focal point of the mirror. Circular waves can be produced by dropping a single drop of water into the ripple tank. If this is done at the focal point of the \"mirror\" plane waves will be reflected back. Refraction If a sheet of glass is placed in the tank, the depth of water in the tank will be shallower over the glass than elsewhere. The speed of a wave in water depends on the depth, so the ripples slow down as they pass over the glass. This causes the wavelength to decrease. If the junction between the deep and shallow water is at an angle to the wavefront , the waves will refract. In the diagram above, the waves can be seen to bend towards the normal. The normal is shown as a dotted line. The dashed line is the direction that the waves would travel if they had not met the angled piece of glass. In practice, showing refraction with a ripple tank is quite tricky to do. The sheet of glass needs to be quite thick, with the water over it as shallow as possible.

This maximizes the depth difference and so causes a greater velocity difference and therefore greater angle. If the water is too shallow, viscous drag effects cause the ripples to disappear very quickly. The glass should have smooth edges to minimize reflections at the edge. Diffraction If a small obstacle is placed in the path of the ripples, and a slow frequency is used, there is no shadow area as the ripples refract around it, as shown below on the right. A faster frequency may result in a shadow, as shown below on the right. If a large obstacle is placed in the tank, a shadow area will probably be observed. If an obstacle with a small gap is placed in the tank the ripples emerge in an almost semicircular pattern. If the gap is large however, the diffraction is much more limited. Small , in this context, means that the size of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the ripples. Diffraction from a grid A phenomenon identical to the x-ray diffraction of x-rays from an atomic crystal lattice can also be seen, thus demonstrating the principles of crystallography . If one lowers a grid of obstacles into the water, with the spacing between the obstacles roughly corresponding to the wavelength of the water waves, one will see diffraction from the grid. At certain angles between the grid and the oncoming waves, the waves will appear to reflect off the grid; at other angles, the waves will pass through. Similarly, if the frequency (wavelength) of the waves is altered, the waves will also alternately pass through or be reflected, depending on the precise relationship between spacing, orientation and wavelength. Interference Interference can be produced by the use of two dippers that are attached to the main ripple bar.

The Tobelo-speaking heartland is in the six administrative districts ( Indonesian : kecamatan ) of Tobelo, located on the western shore of Kao Bay and forming the central part of Halmahera Utara Regency . Other Tobelo speaking areas are the five districts of Wasile (the northwestern half of East Halmahera Regency ; where they are actually speakers of the Tugutil language which is very related to Tobelo) on the south and east coast of Kao Bay, and the northern half of Morotai Island . The district capital, also known as Tobelo , serves as a regional commercial and administrative center and is the largest settlement on Halmahera. Dialects Six principal dialects are generally recognized (Voorhoeve 1988): Heleworuru Boeng Dodinga Lake Paca Kukumutuk Popon The last three dialects are also known as Tugutil . The Tugutil varieties may include additional dialectal variants, but this has not been satisfactorily documented (Voorhoeve 1988). Intelligibility is not great (Ethnologue). In addition, based on cognition percentages in a basic vocabulary list, Voorhoeve 1988 identifies five other North Halmaheran language varieties as dialects of the putative Northeast Halmaheran language. Together with Tobelo, these varieties are Galela , Loloda , Modole , Pagu , and Tabaru . Most speakers consider these to be distinct languages from Tobelo, although they do acknowledge a certain degree of mutual intelligibility.

Togutil Directionals Most all of the 50 languages of Maluku have some sort of directional system . At the least the up/down distinction seems to be an areal feature . But this brings up the chicken and the egg phenomenon. Is this directional system of AN or NAN origin? Or is it a mixture? Perhaps it is not a coincidence that the Tobelo are the most widespread ethnic group in Maluku, with sizable emigrant population throughout the province. We can a least be sure that the Malay directionals are the \"egg\", because Malay as spoken in Western Indonesia does not use these directionals whereas Moluccan Malay uses direct calques of the Tobelo terms: bawah , atas , darat , laut . Tobelo directionals are described in Taylor (1984). Tobelo directional adverbs occur: on motion verbs to specify direction of motion on nouns to specify motion away from or toward an object Thus, interpretation of directional adverbs is entirely context-dependent. For example, o NM tau house t-oiki 1AGT -go o tau t-oiki NM house 1AGT-go 'I'm going to the house' If I meet you landwards of the house, this means that I'm headed inland from my house. If I meet you seawards of the house, then it means I'm headed inland to the house.

Early life and career Dhanis was born in London in 1861. His father was a Belgian merchant and his mother was an Irish woman named Brigitte Maher. He spent the first fourteen years of his life at Greenock , where he received his early education. After completing his education at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels , he entered the Belgian army, joining the Regiment of Grenadiers , in which he eventually rose to the rank of Major. Congo Free State As soon as he reached the rank of Lieutenant, he volunteered for service in the Congo Free State of King Leopold II of Belgium , and in 1887 he went out for a first term. He did so well in founding new stations north of the Congo that, when the government decided to put an end to the Arab domination on the Upper Congo, he was selected to command the chief expedition sent against the slave traders in the 'Congo Arab war'. The Congo Arab war began in April 1892, and it was not brought to a successful conclusion until January 1894. The story of this war was narrated in detail by Sidney Langford Hinde , who took part in it, in his book The Fall of the Congo Arabs . The principal achievements of the campaign were the capture in succession of the three Arab strongholds at Nyangwe , Kasongo and Kabambari. For his services, Dhanis was awarded the noble title of baron , and in 1895 was made vice-governor of the Congo Free State.

His troops were largely composed of the Batetela tribes who had only been recently enlisted. The Batetela under Dhanis were well-armed and experienced mercenaries. The Batetela had been irritated by the execution of some of their chiefs, allegedly for cannibalism , they mutinied and murdered many of their white officers in what has become known as the Batetela Rebellion . From 1897 to 1898, Dhanis was constantly occupied by the rebellion. Eventually, he succeeded in breaking up the several bands of Batetela. In 1899, Baron Dhanis returned to Belgium with the honorary rank of vice governor-general. He died in Brussels on 13 November 1909.

She is voiced by Mae Whitman . She has been well received by both critics and fans of the show, who praised her character development and Whitman's performance. Character Amity Blight is a 14-year-old inhabitant of the Boiling Isles, an archipelago located in the Demon Realm. The Demon Realm is a realm apart from the Human Realm, which can be accessed through the means of portals, or as shown in the series, a magical door. She has very pale, white skin, short hair and an undercut (which she has dyed both green and purple throughout the series), yellow eyes, and usually wears black, long-sleeved blouse , red wine-colored pants, and black slip-on shoes while she is out of school. While at Hexside, she wears her chosen Track clothes, which include long, pink sleeves and socks, and a black uniform. She has a fighting style some have called \"unorthodox\". Terrace also said she considered Amity \"more of a jock\" than having a \"punk aesthetic\". Amity undergoes a major character development through the course of the series. She originally starts out as a snobbish student in her first appearance, who belittles her peers (like Willow), due to her superior control and overall performance in Abomination magic. Her grades, coupled with the influence her family has over the school, meant she could be hardly touched by anyone and was beloved by her teachers. However, as the series progressed, it was revealed that Amity was not a standard bully she appeared to be; she has a complex trauma and a case of self-loathing from her toxic upbringing, including emotional abuse from her mother Odalia and bullying from her siblings Emira and Edric, despite the fact that her father would later support her.

In episodes from \"Lost in Language\" to \"Understanding Willow\", it was evident that Amity's harsh and cruel behavior was merely a fa\u00e7ade and that she never wanted to hurt Willow but was forced to do so. She had also pretended to be friends with Boscha and her gang. Amity's desire for real friends and her longing for love and respect were evident throughout the series. Likewise, her enthusiasm for joining the Emperor's Coven was forced upon her by her mother, and she hoped to gain love and respect from her family through it. However, when Luz enters her life, Amity finally begins to come out of the shell that her mother forced her in, and Amity becomes a better person for it, regaining her friendship with Willow and eventually falling in love with Luz. This character shift is given a further visual signifier in the episode \" Through the Looking Glass Ruins \", when Amity's green hair\u2014the color representative of the fa\u00e7ade curated by Odalia\u2014is re-dyed purple as a show of her newfound individuality.

Thanks to Luz's support, Amity regains her friendship with Willow that was previously strained under her parents' influences, ending her fake association with Boscha. For Grom night, Amity is chosen as the Grom Queen, meaning she must enter the school's dungeon and fight Grometheus, a shape-shifting demon that can manifest into the greatest fear of the person fighting it. Luz steps in to replace her in the fight, but Amity has to jump in to save her. At one point, it is revealed Luz was the person she intended to ask out for the dance, and her greatest fear was being rejected by her. After Willow and Gus are forced to quit Luz's grudgby team due to her harsh training, Amity reveals to her that she experienced something similar. Although they narrowly lose a grudgby game, they all gain sympathy and respect of Boscha's teammates.

The preceptory's construction coincided with the advent of the common law and King Richard the Lionheart 's reign who among counties and countries he saw, relatively often visited Herefordshire. The Knights were Hospitallers in the vanguard of the Crusades, whose order also helped fund the wars. The house has replaced the Norman England -built preceptory.

History This village of about 600 inhabitants was once called Vaucluse or the \"closed valley\" ( Vallis Clausa in Latin) and gave its name to the French department of Vaucluse. Several trails indicate human occupation in the area since the Neolithic . Its spring has been the object of a major cult since Antiquity, and the Sorgue was used as a trade route by the Phoenicians of Massalia and later the Romans . Following some major discoveries from two cave dives by the SSFV, two archaeological sites under the protection of the SRA PACA has allowed more than 1600 antique coins from the first century BC to the 5th century AD to be brought back up to the surface. During the Early Middle Ages , in the 6th century, the hermit Saint Veran is said to have lived on the spot. Miracles attributed to him led to his being consecrated as Bishop of Cavaillon . His successor, Walcaudus, received the consent of the ruling counts of the area to settle monks there. A monastery was constructed, but was in ruins by the 11th century. Clement, the Bishop of Cavaillon, ordered its reconstruction by Isarn, abbot of Sainte-Victoire. In the Late Middle Ages , the poet Petrarch made it his preferred residence in the 14th century, writing, \"The illustrious source of the Sorgue, famous for itself long ago, became even more famous by my long stay and my songs.\" (Petrarch, Seniles , X, 2). The poet left in 1353 after his son's death. The village was razed shortly afterward by bandits, who withdrew at the sight of the intimidating episcopal seat.

The village was razed shortly afterward by bandits, who withdrew at the sight of the intimidating episcopal seat. A museum stands on the spot of Petrarch's house today, and the town is twinned with Arqu\u00e0 Petrarca, where the poet died. Following this attack, the village and valley fell into oblivion. Thought of as a wild place, it was avoided through the 16th and 17th centuries. Vaucluse was again popularized by a duel between the famous Honore Gabriel Riqueti and Louis-Francois de Galliffet. A letter published by Riqueti brought fame to the area again, and a column was built to honour Petrarch in the eighteenth century. In 1946, Jacques Cousteau and another diver nearly died while searching for the bottom of the spring due to contamination of their air supply by carbon monoxide. Population Places and monuments Ch\u00e2teau de Fontaine de Vaucluse Porte du Ch\u00e2teau The principal point of interest is the source of the Sorgue at the foot of a cliff 240 metres high: Its average flow is 22 m 3 / second, the highest in France, and can attain 110 m 3 after the snow melts. It wasn't until 1985 that the mystery of its origin was partially revealed: in effect, the lowest point is at -308m depth attained by a robot belonging to the Spelunking Society of Fontaine de Vaucluse. The spring is the only exit point of a subterranean basin of 1200 km 2 that collects the water from Mont Ventoux , the Vaucluse mountains and from the Lure mountain.

At the time of the municipality's first documentary mention in 1122, its name was given as Drodingishusen, and then in 1135 Drohtenhusen, in 1328 Dreieckshusen and in 1335 Drechlingshusen. From the 1135 documents comes the information that Trechtingshausen in the \u201cparish of Saint Clement\u201d was under the ownership of Kornelim\u00fcnster Abbey near Aachen . Because it was so far away, the monastery appointed knights ( V\u00f6gte ) as bailiffs and protectors. They had their seat at Reichenstein Castle .

On 6 September 1270, the Cornelim\u00fcnster Monastery sold the whole parish of Saint Clement to the Cathedral Chapter at Mainz and St. Maria ad Gradus, also at Mainz. The robber knights, though, kept to their nefarious ways until Emperor Rudolph I destroyed Reichenstein Castle in 1282 and had the robber knights put to death near Saint Clement's Chapel ( Clemenskapelle ). In 1290, Dietrich von Hohenfels unlawfully sold the rebuilt castle and Trechtingshausen to the mighty Count Palatine Louis II, Duke of Bavaria (\u201cLouis the Strict\u201d). Disagreements between Mainz and the Count Palatine were not worked out until 1344; Trechtingshausen and Reichenstein Castle passed for good to Mainz. Trechtingshausen and Niederheimbach became a collective municipality and were assigned to the Amt of Bingen. Each municipality had a Schulthei\u00df (roughly \u201creeve\u201d). The Oberschulthei\u00df (roughly \u201csheriff\u201d) had his seat in Niederheimbach .

A business known far beyond Trechtingshausen's limits is the stoneworks, which quarries quartzitic greywacke from a strip mine and processes it. The strip mine's roots go back to the 17th century. Since 1963, the quarry has been owned by the de Beijer family. Its location near the Rhine and the railway line affords it good links to international transport routes. Among other things, the quarry's products are used to maintain and expand coastal protection in the Netherlands . Moreover, tourism is an important income earner for the municipality. Transport Right through the municipality runs Bundesstra\u00dfe 9 linking Mainz to Koblenz. The Autobahnen A 60 and A 61 can be reached through the Bingen Mitte interchange about 11 km away.

South Lakeland Parks specialised in developing and operating holiday parks with caravans and timber lodge accommodation. The parks included holiday home hire and holiday home sales, while the Fallbarrow site had two holiday cottages on site. In 2013 management of the sites was taken over by Park Resorts . History The company was established in 1988 as South Lakeland Caravans . The parks promoted three different styles of holiday - lakeside (parks based in the Lake District), countryside (parks based in the Troutbeck Valley) and seaside (parks based in the Morecambe Bay areas). In June 2006, LGV acquired South Lakeland Caravans Limited, which was rebranded as South Lakeland Parks. South Lakeland Parks predominantly operated the owner-occupier model, generating most of its revenue from the sale of caravans and lodges and was one of the country's leading providers of timber-lodge units, a market which demonstrated high growth in the 2000s. LGV had a strong management team led by CEO, Graham Hodgson and LGV supplemented the team with the appointments of a Finance Director and Martin Leppard as Non-Executive Chairman. After LGV took over the group, South Lakeland Parks embarked on a \u00a33 million investment programme to upgrade the quality of the parks. Improvements across the nine parks included new timber lodge developments, new internet caf\u00e9 facilities, an indoor swimming pool and better facilities for disabled guests.

Early life Mora was born Gunter Morawski on 26 June 1913 in Leipzig , Germany, of Jewish Polish heritage. As a young medical student Mora became a member of a communist cell and fled Germany to Paris in 1930. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Georges left Paris to join the cause. After a plane crash, he was a prisoner of war for a short time. He was active in the French Resistance in World War II, using the alias Georges Morand. After the War, Georges worked as a patent dealer and became the director of a Jewish rehabilitation home for children run by \u0152uvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) in Paris. Later In 1947 he married Parisian artist and fellow Jewish refugee Mirka Zelik , becoming a French citizen. New York and Melbourne In 1949, after the birth of Georges' and Mirka's first son Philippe Mora (a filmmaker), they joined his family in New York , then in July 1951 moved on to McKinnon , Melbourne where he adopted the name Georges Mora. With characteristic adaptability he took up management of a matzo factory. Seeking more romantic quarters Georges and Mirka moved into Grosvenor Chambers ( Ola Cohn 's former studio) at 9 Collins Street Melbourne (the so called 'Paris End').

Patrons ate from Expressionist crockery by Arthur Boyd and John Perceval , were seated on surrealist furniture, and surrounded by murals and sculptures by Clifford Last , Ian Sime and Julius Kane. Contemporary Art Society and MOMAA In 1956, Georges Mora was elected President of the Contemporary Art Society and declared at a CAS meeting that: \"We must break down this prejudice in the world that Australia is an artistically backward country. There is only one solution: that is, the pushing of Australian artistic achievements into the world and to bring the world\u2019s artistic achievements into this country.\" Artists donated paintings towards an inaugural fundraising exhibition in 1957. In 1958 Mora helped John and Sunday Reed transform the Contemporary Art Society gallery, where George's wife Mirka had exhibited in August the year before into the ' Museum of Modern Art (and Design) of Australia ' (MOMAA), modelled on MoMA in New York, with John as its director and located in Tavistock Place, a lane-way off 376 Flinders Street , Melbourne.

The opening show there included lithographs by Renoir secured through his work as a dealer for Daniel Wildenstein . Georges travelled to the USA and Europe promoting the international reputation of Australian art, and selling European, American and Australian art into his adopted country's national, state, regional and corporate collections, lending work for a very significant Bonnard exhibition touring Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth state museums in 1971. Exhibitions in the first years (1967\u201369) of the new gallery also presented radical hard-edge abstractions by Dale Hickey and Robert Hunter and sculpture by Ti Parks. William Mora joined his father in running the gallery before setting up his own in the city.

Function The major role of the vitelline membrane is to prevent the mixing of the yolk and albumen and also act as an important anti-microbial barrier, as indicated by the high content of lysozyme in the outer layer Vitelline membrane outer layer protein I (VMO-I) binds tightly to ovomucin fibrils, which construct the backbone of the outer layer membrane. VMO-I has considerable activity to synthesize N-acetylchito-oligosaccharide from N-acetylglucosamine hexasaccharides but no hydrolysis activity. VMO-I is composed of 163 aa Structure The structure consists of three beta-sheets forming Greek key motifs , which are related by an internal pseudo three-fold symmetry . Furthermore, the structure of VOMI has strong similarity to the structure of the delta-endotoxin, as well as a carbohydrate-binding site in the top region of the common fold .

During the Cultural Revolution he, along with fellow table tennis players Jiang Yongning and Yong Guotang , was accused of being a spy simply for the fact that he was originally from Hong Kong. Due to the public humiliation and physical torture inflicted upon him, he was driven to suicide by hanging in Beijing in 1968. Chiang Yung-Ning and Yong Guaotang were also forced into suicide by the same public harassment and torture. He was politically rehabilitated in 1978.

Bakery mixes do not require refrigeration. 1950s box of Pillsbury's Golden Yellow cake mix History Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood of the Pearl Milling Company, developed Aunt Jemima, the first \"ready mix.\" The baking mix was designed for people to just add water to create a mixture that could create pancakes. Carl Smith, a sales executive at General Mills, got the idea of selling a pre-mixed blend of flour, salt, baking powder, and lard to create biscuits from a chef on a train in 1930. After Smith pitched the idea for a biscuit mix to sell, head chemist of General Mills, Charlie Kress, created Bisquick. Bisquick entered the market in 1931. In the 1940s, Bisquick began using \"a world of baking in a box,\" and printed recipes for other baked goods such as dumplings, muffins, and coffee cake. In 1933, Pittsburgh molasses company, P. Duff and Sons, patented the first cake mix after blending dehydrated molasses with dehydrated flour, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients. P. Duff and Sons created the cake mix to move surplus molasses, requiring 100 pounds of molasses for every 100 pounds of wheat flour. After World War Two, flour companies such as General Mills, and Pillsbury, began selling cake mixes due to the surplus of flour. By the 1950s, there were hundreds of cake mix companies.

Use of eggs The Duff company patented a baking mixture requiring fresh eggs in 1935 with writing in the patent application, \u201cThe housewife and the purchasing public in general seem to prefer fresh eggs and hence the use of dried or powdered eggs is somewhat of a handicap from a psychological standpoint.\" Other companies would continue to use powdered eggs in their bakery mixes, and it's not until sales flattened between 1956 and 1960 that major food companies would revise their formula to incorporate fresh eggs. Ernest Dichter, an analyst for General Mills, interviewed women that used the cake mixes and reported that the simplicity of the mixes made women feel too self indulgent because there wasn't enough work involved. While some say that the difference caused by using fresh eggs was purely psychological, others argued that the inclusion of fresh eggs simply created better products. The cake mix with dried eggs frequently tasted of eggs, stuck to the pan and had poorer texture.

Unusual for handheld grenade launchers, the QLZ-87 fires high-velocity grenades of 35x32 mmSR caliber , which provides a longer range and flatter firing trajectory. It is the first ever indigenous automatic grenade launcher in China. The QLZ-87 is being complemented by the QLZ-04 , which is fed from a belt and thus is better suited to be mounted on tripods and vehicles. Development The Chinese began attempting to develop an automatic grenade launcher in 1982 at the East China Institute of engineering (Now Nanjing University of Science and Technology ), though development fell short after four years. In September 1986, the PLA General Staff Department began a procurement program for automatic grenade launchers, launching a contest between the East China Institute of Technology (Previously the East China Institute of Engineering) in joint with Factory 5316 (Now Zhejiang Xianfeng Machinery Limited), Factory 9449, Factory 925 and Factory 996 against a union of Hunan based military industries comprising Factory 9596 (Now Zijiang Machinery Factory), Factory 343, Factory 948 and Factory 9624. The contract was won by the Hunan based military industries due to their contract being cheaper. Factory 9596 was in charge of developing the grenade launcher itself, Factory 343 was in charge of the anti-personnel ammunition, Factory 9624 was in charge of ammunition fuses, Factory 5618 developed the scope and Factory 9634 developed the primer.

Due to this, the Hunan factories and East China Institute of Technology decided to merge their projects and began jointly developing the QLZ-87 in 1990. The QLZ-87 entered service in February 1996, and was first seen publicly in 1997 in use with the HK garrison. QLZ-87 in bipod configuration Design QLZ-87 carried by Ugandan soldiers on the African Union mission It can fire a variety of 35 mm grenades stored in the 6-or 15-round cartridge drum . The Type 87 is described by NORINCO as \"Mini Infantry Artillery\". The two most common types of grenades are the 35x32SR DFS87 HE (High Explosive) and DFJ87 HEDP (High Explosive, Dual Purpose) variants. The HEDP 35 mm grenade pierces armour up to 80 mm thick and produces fragments to kill or wound personnel within 5 meters of the point of impact. The HE 35mm grenade has a stated fragmentation casualty radius of 10\u201311 meters. The Type 87 can fire on a tripod or by using the bipod fixed on the barrel. It can also be mounted on armored vehicles or helicopters. The launcher is capable of attacking low-flying air targets as well as targets on the ground.

It serves as the municipal seat of the eponymous Sain Alto Municipality . Climate Sain Alto has a cold steppe climate. The average annual temperature in the town is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). The warmest month is May, with an average temperature of 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F), and the coldest is January, at 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F). Average annual rainfall is 559 mm (22.0 in). The wettest month is September, with an average of 146 mm (5.7 in) of precipitation, and the driest is March, at 1 mm (0.039 in). History Sain Alto derives from Za\u00edn or \u00c7ayn, a group of Zacateco people who established the settlement of Sain Alto sometime around 1535\u20131540. These people were led by a cacique named Sa\u00edn Alonso. The town's full name was originally \"San Sebasti\u00e1n con el renombre de Sa\u00edn\", but it eventually became known as San Sebasti\u00e1n de Sa\u00edn Alto and later simply Sain Alto. The earliest Spanish conquistadors to come into contact with the people of Za\u00edn were Gin\u00e9s V\u00e1zquez de Mercado in 1552 and 1553, and Francisco de Ibarra in September 1554. With the first Zacatecas state constitution of 1825, Sain Alto became the seat of its own municipality. The latter became a free municipality on 19 August 1916. Mercury mining began in the municipality in 1934, and accounted for 12% of Mexico's mercury production in the years of 1939 and 1940. Demographics In the 2020 Mexican Census, Sain Alto recorded a population of 5,295 inhabitants. References Retrieved from \" https://en", "source_type": "fixed"}

It is also identified in some scholarly sources as the Moulay al-Ksour Mosque or Mawl\u0101 al-Q\u1e63\u016br Mosque . The mosque is located in the Ksour neighbourhood on a major souk street, Souk Laksour, near the street's entrance in the Bab Ftouh area just north of Jemaa el-Fnaa . The mosque was founded by a student of Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti , a 12th-century Muslim saint or Sufi figure. The mosque's name derives from a traditional story in which the founder's cat was recruited to eliminate a rat infestation in the house of a vizier . The building was renovated in the 14th century during the Marinid Sultanate , making it one of the few surviving monuments from this period of the city, and is notable for its small but richly decorated minaret . History View of the mosque and its minaret in 1924 According to local tradition, the mosque was founded by Mas'ud, a master tanner who was also a student of Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti (d. 1204; also known locally as Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s and one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh ). This tradition recounts that a vizier whose house became infested by rats requested Mas'ud's aid in eliminating the problem after hearing that the latter had a cat who could get the job done. When Mas'ud refused to give him the cat, the vizier stole it, but the problem only increased until the vizier relented and compensated Mas'ud.

The mosque was renovated in the Marinid period by a Wattasid vizier named Abu Muhammad Abdallah al-Zugunduri (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a ), who died in 768 AH (1366-1367 CE). It was at this time that its small minaret was built. According to a study by Henri Basset and Henri Terrasse , its construction must have occurred around the same time as that of the Ben Salah Mosque (1321 CE), also in Marrakesh, or shortly after. Architecture Detail of the decoration on the lower part of the minaret The mosque is relatively small and its prayer hall covers an area of no more than 120 m 2 (1,300 sq ft). Its main architectural feature of note is its small brick minaret, which is one of the few surviving monuments in Marrakesh to date from the Marinid period. The minaret is almost an exact copy of the minaret of the contemporary Ben Salah Mosque, except on a smaller scale. It has the typical cuboid form of minarets in the Maghreb, with a main shaft topped by a smaller \" lantern \" or turret . The top of the minaret was rebuilt at a later period. Like the Ben Salah minaret, each of the four fa\u00e7ades of the tower's main shaft is mostly covered by an interlacing sebka motif (a lobed lozenge-like or \"net\"-like pattern), carved into the brick surface.

This decorative composition is more complex and once again resembles a similar composition found on the lower fa\u00e7ades of the Ben Salah minaret. The small window has a trilobed shape and is framed by a blind lambrequin arch , which in turn is framed by a small rectangular alfiz . Above this is a small Square Kufic composition containing a eulogical inscription, flanked by two eight-pointed stars. Some faience decoration was once also included in the spandrels around the window. Around and above this is a much larger decorative composition consisting of a blind multifoil arch , with a horseshoe shape , nested under a plain semi-circular blind arch, between which runs a sebka pattern radiating outwards from the center. This in turn is framed by another rectangular alfiz , with the spandrels filled with another sebka motif.

He was educated at Shoreham Grammar School and Lancing College . He studied at the \u00c9cole de Dessin in Paris, the Architectural Association School of Architecture and at the Royal College of Art before being apprenticed to George Edwards . Career Kingwell began in private practice in London in 1886. In 1899, he drew up plans for buildings in Beech Hill Park Estate when he was practising at 103\u2013104 Cheapside , London, noting on them that he was \"sole agent\".

Although not a churchgoer himself, he presented a stained glass window of St Paul to the church in his wife's name and left the church \u00a3100 in his will. In an obituary it was claimed that Kingwell was one of the first architects to build and reinforce buildings in London using concrete. Personal life In 1885, Kingwell, of Albert House, Theobald's Road , was sued by William Haviland and his wife Amy Coleridge for the return of \u00a35 that was said by them to have been lent to him by Amy in 1883 when she was acting in New York before her marriage. It was said in evidence that before she went to America, Kingwell and Amy had been lovers. He had given her a ring and her letters from America had referred to him as \"my husband\" but she had subsequently married Haviland without Kingwell's knowledge. Kingwell had thought them engaged. Amy had been in the habit of giving Kingwell money as he was an architect in \"very poor circumstances\". She had written to him saying \"everything I have must belong to you\". Amy's mother, Adelaide M'Kay, an actress by the stage name of Wilmore, pointed out however that Kingwell was the son of a successful coach builder.

'little red book'), known in English as RedNote , is a Chinese social networking and e-commerce platform. As of 2020 , 70% of the platform's users are reportedly born after 1990, and nearly 70% of them are female. In January 2025, the app gained an influx of new users from the United States and other parts of the world due to the anticipated shutdown of TikTok 's U.S. operations in accordance with the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act . Xiaohongshu has been called \"China's answer to Instagram \". Etymology The app was initially called \"Hong Kong Shopping Guide\" and targeted Chinese tourists. According to co-founder Mao Wenchao , the name Xiaohongshu ( lit. ' little red book ' ) was inspired by his career at Bain & Company and education at the Stanford Graduate School of Business ; both institutions feature red as their main color. \"Little Red Book\" is also the English nickname for the 1964 Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung , known during the Cultural Revolution as \u7ea2\u5b9d\u4e66 ( pinyin : H\u00f3ngb\u01ceosh\u016b ; lit. 'Red Treasured Book'). The company has stated that the platform's name is not a reference to the compilation book. Internationally, the app was branded as RED from 2022 through 2023, then listed under the name REDnote on the Google Play store beginning in September 2024.

History Xiaohongshu was founded by Miranda Qu and Charlwin Mao in 2013 as an online tour guide for Chinese shoppers, providing a platform for users to review products and share their shopping experiences with the community. In 2015, Xiaohongshu set up its warehouses in Shenzhen , Guangdong and Zhengzhou , Henan. On 6 June 2017, Xiaohongshu held a shopping festival to celebrate its fourth anniversary, which saw the sales revenue exceed CN\u00a5100 million in two hours, while the app ranked in first place in the iOS App Store under the \"Shopping\" category that day. In June 2018, the Alibaba Group and Tencent invested US$300 million in Xiaohongshu, with a valuation of US$3 billion. Due to the platform's early focus on fashion and beauty trends, Xiaohongshu's user base was predominantly female in its early years. 90% of Xiaohongshu users were women, according to a report published in April 2021. The app had attracted affluent Gen Z female users in urban China as an alternative to Instagram , which is blocked in the country. Xiaohongshu subsequently adjusted its corporate strategy to attract more male users to maintain its growth. In 2021, it announced that the platform would promote male user content. By 2022, 30% of Xiaohongshu users were male. There was criticism that the strategy, as well as Xiaohongshu's algorithm, increased harassment on the platform and made women feel less welcome.

By 2022, 30% of Xiaohongshu users were male. There was criticism that the strategy, as well as Xiaohongshu's algorithm, increased harassment on the platform and made women feel less welcome. An external advertising agency marketed Xiaohongshu on other websites as a place to see \"Beautiful ladies... without spending any money!\" and \"Sexy, beautiful car models and stylish beauties\", which the company later apologized for. In 2023, Sequoia China bought the Xiaohongshu shares in multiple transactions at a valuation of $14 billion. According to the Financial Times , Xiaohongshu completed a round of stake sales of existing shares to new and former investors around July 2024 that valued the company at around $17 billion. This round saw participation from prominent venture capital investors, including DST Global , HongShan (formerly Sequoia China), Hillhouse Investment , Boyu Capital , and CITIC Capital . The platform, which already has significant backing from Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba, achieved profitability in 2023 with a net profit of $500 million on revenues of $3.7 billion. It generates revenue primarily through advertising, particularly from cosmetics brands. However, it faces challenges as many users purchase recommended items on other platforms such as Taobao and Tmall, limiting Xiaohongshu's direct e-commerce potential. Despite having a large user base of over 300 million monthly active users with high engagement, its total revenue remains significantly lower than Douyin 's. 2025 influx of American users In January 2025, the banning of TikTok in the U.S. caused many American users to look for an alternative, leading to a significant increase in Xiaohongshu downloads .

American users described the move to Xiaohongshu both as a way to preserve a TikTok-like community and as a kind of protest against U.S. government pressure on TikTok. It also gave Chinese users a chance to interact with a large number of English speakers. With state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) supporting the influx, most Chinese citizens warmly welcomed U.S. users, while some Chinese nationalist bloggers warned against American influence. NYU Shanghai professors Anna Greenspan and Bogna Konior cite the influx of \"TikTok refugees\" to Xiaohongshu as an example of how \"West fears, scepticism, and punitive approach ... has paradoxically helped to enable the development of a distinct and competitive Chinese media environment.\" Key trend Short\u2011form video \u2014 Videos continue to grow as the preferred format, but more users are posting short tutorials, reviews, and clips rather than long videos with long texts.

By sharing their product experiences, while influencers and users encourage others to make purchases based on their recommendations, they spread information on the platform and help users with various needs to find what they need or plan for. Search As Xiaohongshu focuses on lifestyle topics, the ecosystem has given it a growing advantage in competition with traditional Chinese search engines, making it a new generation search engine and earning it the reputation of \"National Lifestyle Guide\". Xiaohongshu recorded almost 600 million daily search queries in Q4 2024, reportedly half that of Baidu and doubled over the past year. In January 2025, Xiaohongshu is introducing Diandian, an AI-powered search tool, which is currently in beta testing.

Actions such as sending WeChat contacts in posts or DMs or inquiring about prices of goods can lead to account suspension. In 2022, China Digital Times published leaked documents showing how Xiaohongshu's content moderation teams censor or limits posts about topics sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), including mentions of derogatory nicknames for CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping , and discussion of events such as labor strikes , geographic discrimination, student suicides and criticism of the CCP. Users noted that topics such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre or Free Hong Kong are censored on the platform. Following the growth in users from the United States, Xiaohongshu was said to be exploring adjusting its content review processes as American influencers began sharing posts. According to Wired and The Beijing News , Xiaohongshu announced an urgent recruitment of English content moderators to expand its content moderation team. On 14 January 2025, Xiaohongshu announced that it would direct users to more \"positive\" content in line with a November 2024 directive from the Cyberspace Administration of China . That same month, when asked about the platform's censorship in a press briefing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun replied that \"no matter what platforms you use, it's a personal choice\" further adding that the Chinese government encourages and supports \"person-to-person exchanges\".

Reception In October 2021, Xiaohongshu received criticism for condoning heavily filtered, stylized photographs and perfectly captured imagery that was becoming increasingly common on the platform's feeds. On 17 October 2021, the platform issued a statement on WeChat to acknowledge that there was a problem of travel influencers posting \"overly beautified\" photos of scenic spots. According to the statement, Xiaohongshu issued an apology and indicated that because \"bloggers did not clearly label their works as creative photography, people interpreted them as part of travel guides. Users who visited the locations were disappointed by the differences between their expectations and reality\". Moreover, Xiaohongshu decided to transfer the IPO from the United States to Hong Kong. According to a Bloomberg News report in July, this included requiring all companies holding the data of more than 1 million users to submit a cyber security review, which was one of the reasons for the suspension of Xiaohongshu's listing in the United States. In December 2021, in response to loss of public trust towards the authenticity of content hosted on its platform, Xiaohongshu formed a dedicated team to identify and remove fraudulent content.

Xiaohongshu asked for US$1.57 million in compensation for damage to its reputation and the infringement of consumer rights on its platform. On 25 January 2022, reports emerged that Xiaohongshu has received a fine totaling \u00a5300,000 from local authorities in Shanghai for failing to remove content that was deemed harmful to minors. The fine relates to a violation of cybersecurity law that guarantees protection for minors after an earlier media report was made by state broadcaster CCTV in December 2021, that it found videos posted on Xiaohongshu showing underage girls in various states of undress, featured in advertisements for underwear brands.

The vacancy arose when Romeo Acop , the incumbent, died on December 20, 2025. This is the first election since Hagedorn vs. House of Representatives case, where the Supreme Court ruled that the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) can call a special election even without notification from the House. Electoral system Each congressional district of the Philippines sends one representative to the House of Representatives. An election to the seat is via first-past-the-post , in which the candidate with the most votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the seat. Based on Republic Act (RA) No. 6645, in order for a special election to take place, the seat must be vacated, the relevant chamber notifies the COMELEC the existence of a vacancy, then the COMELEC schedules the special election. RA No. 7166 supposedly removed the condition of the chamber informing the commission of the vacancy, but the COMELEC still had always waited on the chamber's resolution before scheduling a special election. After the Hagedorn vs. House of Representatives decision by the Supreme Court in 2025, this is the first special election where the commission no longer has to wait for a congressional resolution to call for a special election. The case arose after then incumbent of Palawan's 2nd district , Edward Hagedorn , died, and that the House of Representatives did not issue a resolution mandating the COMELEC to hold the special election, which led the seat to be vacant until the end of the 19th Congress Meanwhile, according to Republic Act (RA) No. 8295, should only one candidate file to run in the special election,", "source_type": "fixed"}

An early example is Robert d'Abbetot , who is listed as Robert le Dispenser ('the steward'), a tenant-in-chief of several counties, in the Domesday Book of 1086. In early times, the surname was usually written as le Despenser , Dispenser or Despencer \u2014notably in works such as the Domesday Book and the Scottish Ragman Rolls of 1291 and 1296, but gradually lost both the \"le\" article and the unstressed first syllable of the longer surname to become Spencer. As an occupational surname, Despenser/Spencer families would have originated in a range of different jurisdictions, and the possession of the shared surname is not an indication of genealogical relationship. The surname Spencer has gained in frequency over time. In the 19th century it also become popular as a given name\u2014especially in the more anglicised areas of the United States.

Other countries and cultures Foreign equivalents: German and Yiddish : Speiser \u2013 a steward. This is a derivative of the Middle High German spise , meaning food or supplies via the Old High German \u2014in turn derived from Late Latin expe(n)sa ( pecunia ), or \"(money) expended\". Greek : Economos \u2013 the anglicised surname derived from the Greek oikonomos (\"oi\" in Greek pronounced as a long E.) Oiko- (English = \u0113co-) is a root meaning \"house\" in classical Greek. This surname has the same occupational derivation as Spencer but, like the surnames Stewart and Stuart, has a different etymology. The original meaning of oikonomos was a home owner but it evolved to mean estate manager, somebody who was responsible for all resources on the estate, a steward. Oikonomos was a medieval Eastern Roman title for somebody who was in charge of a project or institution; it is still used by the Greek Orthodox church .

In addition to his position as steward, he also was given land grants in county Bedford. He held his office for the period c.1088\u20131098. In England, Robert was best known by his occupation, and hence became known as Robert le Despenser (many spelling variants of this name exist including Robert the Dispensor, Robert Despensator, Robert Dispenser ), which reflected his new official position, of using a patronymic , as Robert fitzThurstin. He seems to have maintained his favor with William because in the Domesday Book of 1086, Robert Despenser was listed as a land tenant-in-chief in Gloucestershire , Leicestershire , Lincolnshire , Oxfordshire , and Warwickshire, as well as holding lands in Worcestershire obtained from the Bishop of Worcester.

Robert's office as the king's steward may also have gone to Urse, as it was later held by Urse's heirs . Subsequent bearers of the Despenser or Spencer surname would not descend from Robert. King's Dispensers The steward of William II of England was Thurstan, Dispensator Regis (royal steward). His son Hugh was Dispensator Regis in 1105 under Henry I , and was followed by his son or brother, Simon, Dispensator Regis for Henry and Stephen . Simon was father of a second Thurstan, who was active in the 1250s under Henry II , to be followed by his son Walter as Dispensator Regis . Walter was succeeded by his brother Aymer, Dispensator Regis under king John , and Aymer's son Thurstan le Despenser, who served under Henry III , dying in 1249. He was followed by a son, Adam le Despenser, who was summoned by Edward I of England to perform military service and in 1283 to attend on the king in what was a precursor to the first royally-convened Parliament. His heir was a son, Aymer le Despenser, but he alienated his lands and titles during the reign of Edward II .

The family captured international attention when Lady Diana Frances Spencer married Prince Charles on 29 July 1981, until her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. Heraldry The varied origins of people with the Spencer and Despenser surnames means that they are not all members of the same family, and each individual family would have distinct coats of arms, while most Spencers are not entitled to bear any arms. The family of the King's Dispensers bore an ermine shield with chief of unknown tincture . The Lords Despencer bore arms from the early days of heraldry, which are one of a family of quarterly arms seen among the vassals of the Earls of Chester. Scholars have suggested a possible derivation from those of the Dutton family, or from the family of their one-time feudal overlords, Beauchamp of Bedford, whose own arms belonged to a shared group of similar bearings among Mandeville and Vere family vassals and descendants. They are described in the language of heraldry as quarterly: 1st & 4th, Argent; 2nd & 3rd, Gules a fret or, over all a bend sable . In 1504, John Spencer of Althorp was granted for himself and his brother the arms: azure, a fess ermine between six sea-mews ' heads erased argent , and in 1564 a descendant of his uncle was granted: sable, on a fess or, between ", "source_type": "fixed"}

As the end of the century approached, however, the family's growing social status would lead them to adopt a forged pedigree that gave them an ancient derivation, and they began using new arms that represented a claimed kinship with the (actually entirely unrelated) Lords Despencer, modifying the earlier family's quarterly arms by the addition of three escallops (scallop shells). Numerous variations of this differenced coat, along with various Spencer arms bearing no resemblance to those of the Lords le Despenser, have been catalogued. Distribution and spread The greatest density of Spencers in present-day England is in Nottinghamshire, followed by Derbyshire. Derby and Notts were closely connected at the time of Domesday, and up until the time of Elizabeth I had the same Sheriff. In North America early settlement of Spencers date to Thomas Spencer in Virginia in 1623; William Spencer, Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1630; Thomas Spencer, Maine 1630. Col. Nicholas Spencer arrived in Virginia in the 1650s and subsequently served as Acting Governor . Spencers arriving in Australia with the convicts of the First Fleet in 1788 were Daniel Spencer from Dorchester, John Spencer, and Mary Spence from Wigan. With the Third Fleet in 1791 came John Spencer from Lancaster and Thomas Spencer from London.

The town is located approximately 36 kilometres (22 mi) south-east of the state capital of Adelaide , adjacent to the Princes Highway . Its postal code is 5250 \u2013 though it has no post office. Post is delivered to the neighbouring town of Littlehampton which shares the post code. The town and surrounding countryside, a mixture of pastureland and eucalypt forest, make up around 16 square kilometres. At the 2021 census , the locality of Blakiston had a population of 377 and a median age of 46. There are no signs or markers to indicate that Blakiston is separate from nearby Littlehampton , and they are increasingly indistinguishable as housing developments encroach. History Blakiston has been occupied by European settlers since 1846. The town was founded by Francis Davison and named for his ancestral home, Blakiston Hall in County Durham . Variant spellings of the name were used until 1850. Buildings Buildings include a roadside pub and stage house (currently a private house), a cheese factory converted to a private residence, St James Church (consecrated in 1846) and neighbouring rectory , a demolished school house and the large residence of Blakiston House, as well as a smaller residence. Rumour has it that the old school house was demolished by rampaging cattle some time in the mid-20th century. In recent years the school house was restored with funding from Mount Barker District Council and a bequest from a local Rotary Club member.

Introduced in July 1934, it remained in production until March 1935 after its replacement, the Type 14, was introduced in February 1935. The Type 13 was basically similar to the earlier 1933 Type 12, but was more stylish in appearance. For the first time, a truck version was also available; the Datsun Type 13T . Design The fully chromed, heart-shaped grille was entirely new and tilted backwards by about ten degrees, unlike the upright design used on earlier Datsuns. The vents on the sides of the bonnet were installed at the same angle as the grille and the earlier cast spoked wheels were replaced with flush, pressed steel items. Aside from the truck and a panel van, there was also a range of two-door passenger car bodies available: a Phaeton, a roadster, and a sedan with suicide doors . Popular as a taxi in Japan, the Type 13 was the first Datsun to be exported, with 44 cars sent mainly to South Africa and Australia. Some cars were sold directly from a ship, touring the world and promoting Japanese-made goods. An attempt to clothe Type 13 bodies with locally made Australian bodywork ended in bankruptcy after a succession of logistical and engineering failures. 880 Type 13s were built in 1934 alone; the total production overall is uncertain. Production As with the Type 12, the chassis was built by Tobata Casting's Automotive Division in Osaka. Tobata Castings merged with the Nihon Sangyo Co. (\"Japan Industries\") in December 1933.

The car retained the 12 PS (8.8 kW) 747 cc engine as used on the Type 12, coupled to the same three-speed manual gearbox. The Type 13 was the last Datsun to be built mainly by subcontractors, before proper integrated series production began in 1935. There are thus large variations in the bodywork and details of any remaining Type 13s.

Doreal claimed that during a 1925 visit to the Great Pyramids of Giza , he discovered a set of ancient emerald tablets belonging to the Egyptian deity Thoth , whom he re-imagined as a king of Atlantis . Doreal then claimed to have translated the text, which he published as the Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Atlantean (not to be confused with the medieval Hermetic text called the Emerald Tablet ). Occult views In around 1930, Maurice Doreal formed the Brotherhood of the White Temple in Denver , having been involved in Theosophy . He claimed that in 1931, in Los Angeles , he met two Atlanteans who took him to a cave underneath Mount Shasta . Doreal quickly developed a cosmology focused on the inner earth, describing \"underground races\" he claimed to have learned about from the Atlanteans. Doreal developed theories of an underground serpent race. During the 1950s, Doreal incorporated aliens into his views. He combined these all into a theory that in the second half of the 20th century, the serpent race would ally with the Antichrist . He believed that there were \"three types of flying saucers including one piloted by 'serpent people' who were once ice-bound in Siberia , became defrosted and then replaced and overthrew the Communist regime in Russia\". In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Doreal relocated the Brotherhood near Sedalia, Colorado , where he predicted that nuclear war would happen in 1953, but that he and his community would be protected by the mountains in the valley they relocated to.

Biography John McPherson Pinckney was born near Hempstead in the Republic of Texas , he was raised on his family's farm near Fields Store . His father, Thomas Shubrick Pinckney, was crippled in a farming accident, leaving the young John to take on most of the work on the farm.

He was reelected to a full term in the House in 1904 and would serve in Congress until his death.

The petition requested that Governor Lanham dispatch the Texas Rangers to enforce local prohibition ordinances, allowed under the state's local option law, due to insufficient enforcement by police and sheriffs. Tensions were high between \"wets\" (against prohibition) and \"drys\" (for prohibition) and supporters of both sides turned out for the gathering. Pinckney, who favored the petition, was first to speak and was routinely shouted down by opponents. Then J. N. Brown, a local lawyer and \"wet\" who was one of the people shouting at the congressman, pulled a pistol and began firing, as did his son Roland, and \"drys\" who were armed began firing back. Pinckney attempted to intervene to end the fight, but was shot in the back and killed when his brother Tom attempted to pull John away and protect him. Also killed were Tom Pinckney, J. N. Brown, and John Mills, a leader of the Prohibition League who succumbed to his wounds the next day. Pinckney's private secretary \"Doc\" Tompkins and Roland Brown were also shot, but survived. The entire gunfight lasted about thirty seconds and more than 75 bullets were found in the wall of the courthouse. Both John and Tom Pinckney were buried at Hempstead City Cemetery. Roland Brown was tried as an accomplice to the murders, but was acquitted when it was concluded that he had only taken out his pistol to protect his father.

The chain's menu focused on steaks and lobsters . A family-run business, Valle's aggressively expanded during the early 1970s but was unable to weather the financial challenges of the gas crisis and the resulting economic downturn; increasing labor costs, the death of its founder, and the changing dining habits of its customers. The last Valle's Steak House closed in August 2000. Key personnel Donald Valle was an American restaurateur who owned and managed the eponymously named Valle's Steak House, from 1933 until his death in 1977. Valle was born in Lettomanopello, Italy in 1908 and immigrated to the United States in 1912 at the age of four. His family settled in Portland, Maine , where Valle eventually opened his first restaurant in 1933. Valle was known as a hard working businessman who logged 14- to 18-hour days throughout his career. Valle was married to the former Sue Crone and had two children, Richard and Judith Valle. Richard Valle was the son of Donald and Sue Valle. Richard Valle was a Korean War veteran who assumed a prominent role in the company during the 1950s. Following the death of his father, Richard Valle served as the president and chief executive officer until November, 1980 when at the age of 49, he was succeeded by Arthur W. Hanson. Richard Valle then assumed the role of company chairman. He maintained that position until he sold his controlling shares of the company in 1982. Richard Valle died on July 8, 1995, at the age of 64.

Hanson assumed control and ownership of the company in 1982. He began his career with Cleaves Food Service Corporation of Silver Spring, Maryland in 1950. In 1959 he joined Valle's as the manager of one of the firm's steakhouses in his home town of Kittery, Maine . Donald Valle appointed him vice president one year later and by 1963 he had been elevated to executive vice president for operations where he was responsible for development, logistics, staffing and training. Hanson remained in control of the company until its closure in 1991.

Early in his career, Donald Valle bypassed regional meat suppliers and established exclusive agreements with Swift and Company in Chicago which shipped beef directly by rail car to his Maine restaurants. Vertically integrated, most of the company's beef originated from Valle's own ranch in Wyoming called the \"Circle V\" and was then shipped to slaughterhouses in Chicago. Valle also invested heavily in making his restaurants efficient. In a 1965 interview with the Boston Globe Richard Valle showed off a $50,000 automatic dishwashing machine located in the kitchen of the chain's new $1.5 million Braintree, Massachusetts , restaurant. Valle also pointed out the row of broilers and the large, in-house bakery that allowed the Braintree location to serve 5,000 customers a day. Donald Valle had a reputation as a tireless worker and expected the same level of effort from his employees. Once, when taking a group of restaurant owners through one of his steak houses, Valle pointed out how trim his workers were because they stayed so busy. When one of the visitors pointed to a heavy set employee, Valle joked \"He's new. Come back in a couple of months and you will see he's slimmed down.\" Training at Valle's was like going through boot camp but without all the pushups. It lasted six months. During that time they worked you like a rented mule. Not many trainees actually finished.

Early history and expansion After operating a small cafe, Donald Valle purchased a larger restaurant in Portland, Maine, and named it \"Valle's Steak House\" Valle's Steak House began as a 12-seat caf\u00e9 in Portland, Maine in 1933. The cafe was purchased at the end of Prohibition by Donald Valle. The cafe was successful and allowed Valle to purchase a larger restaurant in Portland's Woodfords Corner and then a nightclub in Scarborough, Maine which he then converted into a restaurant. Valle next expanded to Kittery, Maine where he constructed his first restaurant that was custom designed as a steak house. In the mid-1960s Valle expanded to Massachusetts where he established three Boston-area steak houses in Saugus , Newton , and Braintree. They became, and remained, three of the busiest restaurants in the chain. In 1968 the company went public and its shares were listed on the American Stock Exchange . By 1969, Valle's was serving over 200,000 customers a week, had 1,300 employees on its payroll, and had created and issued over 6,000 of its own credit cards. By 1970 the company had expanded into Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York and was experiencing record earnings growth. The success of the company attracted a buyout offer from the Campbell Soup Company . At the time of the offer, Valle's was operating 12 restaurants in Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York and had five additional restaurants being developed. For the financial period ending on March 31, 1970, Valle's had netted $1,448,000 on sales of $19,200,000.

Campbell offered to purchase all of the company's assets and assume its liabilities for $38,900,000. Several months after the offer, negotiations collapsed. In the wake of the collapse, Donald Valle stated that the level of control demanded by Campbell would have been detrimental to the continued success of the chain. Valle's Steak House headquarters was in Newton, Massachusetts In 1972, the company had begun construction on two additional steak houses in the Washington, D.C. , area, plus another restaurant in Atlanta . Plans for restaurants in Yonkers , Philadelphia , Fort Lauderdale , and Daytona Beach had been approved and construction was slated to begin in 1973. Valle's had also agreed to sell a parcel of land next to its Hartford restaurant to a national motel chain for $325,000 and to serve as the hotel's sole banquet, lounge, and dining facility. One of the company's locations was in Saugus, Mass adjacent to the Hilltop Steakhouse that was, for a period of time, the highest grossing restaurant in the United States and often had a waiting time for a table that exceeded an hour. While the Valle's location in Saugus was successful, it was also mocked as \"...the place to go when you couldn't get into the Hilltop.\" The Braintree, Mass Valle's was the fifth restaurant in the chain to open and one of the busiest.

Growing inflation, unemployment and rising gas prices caused Richard Valle to warn investors that although the company would continue to expand, earnings would not be able to maintain their momentum. \"Inflation, the cautious attitude of the consumer, and the energy crisis are uncertainties facing the industry.\" By 1977 both revenues and profits had begun to decline. Economic challenges, declining sales, and closure Donald Valle's death in 1977 saddled the Valle family with an estate tax bill it was not prepared to pay. Combined with declining sales and increasing costs from the firm's continued expansion, in 1981 Richard and Judith Valle attempted to sell their controlling shares in the company to a group of non-family executives and private investors for $17,500,000. Two different proposals were provided to shareholders over a 24-month period. At the time of the proposed sale, the Valle family and its trusts owned 66.7% of the company's 2.5 million common stock shares outstanding. The company was operating 32 restaurants that despite generating $65,900,000 in sales, had lost $569,000 for the year ending on March 31, 1981. During the effort to sell their shares, Richard Valle stepped aside as president of the company. In his place, Arthur W. Hanson, 54, formerly executive vice president of operations became president and also acquired the newly created title of chief executive officer. Richard Valle described the change as \"the start of regrouping\" that would allow him to focus on the firm's long-term strategy as the chairman.

The Valle's in Kittery, Maine was the first custom built restaurant in the Valle's Steak House chain and was among the last to close. After the buyout, the chain continued to sell off properties. Between 1982 and 1984 the company sold all of its Florida locations, none of which had been open for more than seven years. By the mid-1980s some of the company's largest restaurants outside of Florida had also closed to include Fall River , Atlanta, and Miami. The Portland restaurant was among those that were sold in 1983 when Judith Valle, using funds from the buyout, purchased the Portland Valle's Steak House from the company and operated the restaurant as an independent entity. Another important development in 1983 was Arthur Hanson creating the Polar Bear Restaurant Corporation headquartered in Needham , Mass as the parent corporation of the remaining restaurants. By agreement with Judith Valle, she was allowed to use the \"Valle's Steak House\" name for her Portland restaurant. The last three Valle's Steak House restaurants operating as part of Hanson's corporation closed on Friday, December 27, 1991. The restaurants were located in Kittery, Maine; Andover, Mass; and Hartford, Connecticut.

Inheritance taxes. The Valle family was unable to pay the sizable inheritance taxes levied on the estate of Donald Valle when he died in 1977 and were forced to liquidate the business in order to meet their obligation to the government. In a June 2000 interview, Judith Valle said, \"No matter how much business we did, we couldn't pay the government. We couldn't break even. It was a huge tax burden, with compounding interest.\" Susan Collins (R), the U.S. Senator from Maine subsequently used Valle's Steak House as an example of the adverse effects of federal tax policies and argued for revised federal laws that eased the burden of estate taxes, especially on family owned businesses. Valle's sign outside of the Albany, New York restaurant. Photo courtesy of Saxton Signs, Castleton, New York. Economic turbulence. The gas crisis, soaring inflation, and rising labor costs battered the chain from the mid-70s through the 1980s. Other companies in the restaurant industry, particularly those in a similar price niche to Valle's, also suffered from declining sales. In a July 1980 interview with the Boston Globe, Richard Valle said \"The guy who went out twice a week now goes out once, and the retired senior citizen, a large proportion of the business, trades down in the items he orders.\" Valle also cited the steady increases in the minimum wage as having a \"... a ripple effect. If you pay your kitchen men $3.10, you have to give your cooks more money, the chef, the meat cutter, the baker, the hostess, the cashier.\" Rising labor costs were exacerbated by the 1981 elimination of the \"tip credit\" which allowed restaurants to reduce the hourly wages of their wait staffs by a portion of the tip.

As a result, Valle's was forced to repeatedly raise prices to offset the higher labor costs and predictably, customer counts dropped. Obsolete business model. Working against Valle's attempt to maintain its revenues was the emphasis of food over liquor despite the fact that the sale of alcohol featured higher markups. Valle's also placed a strong emphasis on service and because of that shunned the self-service salad-bar concept that many restaurants had introduced to reduce labor costs. As energy costs increased, Valle's found the costs of maintaining their expansive restaurants with banquet rooms that seated up to 1,000 to be a burden. \"People aren't having the big 300 to 500 person weddings anymore,\" said Richard Valle in a 1980 interview. \"Weddings are now more like 100 people the annual Christmas banquets that seated 500 to 900 or the big retirement party.\" Richard Valle calculated the average size of the 280 banquets one restaurant booked in 1979 and it came to 77.5 people. Supporting the large restaurants were five acre parking areas that also contributed to the company's overhead costs. By the late 1970s, Richard Valle had designed a downsized restaurant that was less costly to staff, heat, light, and maintain and would need only two and a half acres of land. By then, the company's revenues had begun to deteriorate and Valle could not implement the new design. Valle's was also faulted for the straight line architecture of its large dining rooms that caused some critics to compare the restaurant to a cafeteria.

Jacob Lawson Shinn (October 3, 1826\u2014August 17, 1899) was a prosperous and influential mid to late-nineteenth-century leader in Russellville , Pope County , Arkansas . A successful merchant who established his first store in about 1852, Shinn was instrumental in bringing the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad (LR&FS) through town and moving the county seat from Dover to Russellville. At one time the wealthiest man and largest property owner in Pope County, he donated land for a railway station and right-of-way through Russellville for the LR&FS railroad as well as property for the new courthouse, the Russellville school system, and the church that he and his wife attended. After financial setbacks that reduced his wealth drastically, Shinn continued his service to the community until he died in office months after being elected mayor of Russellville. Migration In 1837, Shinn's family, along with the families of relatives and friends, traveled from Montgomery County , North Carolina by covered wagon when Jacob was 10 years old, settling near the area that would become Russellville. His father, Benjamin Daniel Ransom \"B.D.R.\" Shinn, established a farm and, in 1840, one of the first circular sawmills in Pope County, working as a farmer and lumber dealer until his death. Mexican War Following the outbreak of war with Mexico , Jacob Shinn enlisted as a corporal in a company of mounted infantry volunteers from Pope County organized under Captain James S. \"Symp\" Moffit, in Archibald Yell's Arkansas Mounted Rifles , the unit mustering into federal service at Washington, Arkansas on July 1, 1846, as Company A.

Wool , derisively called Yell's regiment the \"Arkansas Mounted Devils\" over issues such as military order and basic sanitation as most of the regiment did not regularly drill and military discipline was extremely lax. Jacob, by then a sergeant, was mustered out on June 20, 1847, at Camargo , Mexico , on the Rio Grande, and made his way home. Russellville Local tradition holds that the naming of the community came down to a choice between Shinnsville, after merchant Jacob Shinn, and Russellville, after Thomas Russell. However, Russellville was actually named in the early 1840s when Jacob was a teen. Russellville is listed on mail routes in multiple requests for proposals for carrying the mail, including as early as 1842, when Shinn was 15, and, later, 1846, when he was 19, so naming the community after Jacob would have been quite unlikely. In the 1840s, his uncle, James Madison Shinn, and father, B. D. R. Shinn, operated a store in the small frontier community. Any truth in the naming tradition may apply to them. Jacob went to work in his uncle's and father's store in Russellville in 1848 after returning home from the war in Mexico. Early in 1850, Shinn's father went to California, not returning until the summer of 1851.

Merchant, entrepreneur, and local philanthropist In 1852, with a cash capital of $500, Jacob Shinn established one of the first general stores in an area known as Chactas Prairie, just down the road from the log home of Thomas Russell, the area's first doctor. On July 4, 1855, Shinn married Martha Battenfield. They had four sons. Shinn was appointed Russellville postmaster on August 4, 1857, and, after the war, was re-established as postmaster on August 6, 1866. By 1858, Shinn's inventory was valued at $2,000, more than twice the average inventory of the eighteen stores taxed in Pope County that year. In 1860, Shinn was documented as a merchant with $3000 in real estate and $25,000 in personal property. Civil War and Reconstruction Shinn took no active part in the civil war and, like many merchants in the South, suffered significant reverses. Like many, he was opposed to the secession of Arkansas. Shinn and his family may have relocated during the war. The youngest son, Charles, was born \"in Youngstown, Ohio, in June 1864.\" Shinn was a passenger on the steamer American when it struck a snag on the port bow at about 10 P.M. on January 27, 1870.

Within three minutes of striking, the water was waist-deep in the cabin. Shinn finished his journey home by stage. During a portion of the Pope County militia troubles in 1872, Shinn took refuge in Little Rock as did his brother-in-law, Joseph H. Battenfield , whose newspaper office, including press, had been burned by the sheriff's militia. After Pope County Clerk Wallace H. Hickox was killed in Dover on August 31, 1872, Shinn traveled with an eyewitness of the killing, Rev. J. M. P. Hickerson, to Little Rock where Shinn met with Governor O. A. Hadley on September 4 and arranged a meeting between Hadley and Hickerson. Reports said that Frank Hickox, a brother of the slain clerk and another man waylaid the stage between Russellville and Perry Station, at that time the furthest west terminus of the Little Rock & Fort Smith Railroad, thinking to find Hickerson, remove him from the stage and prevent him from seeing the Governor. Shinn and Hickerson bypassed Perry Station, traveling on horseback to Lewisburg, where they took the train. The new store Shinn opened a larger store in a new two-story brick building on Main Street in 1876, with other businesses occupying offices on the second floor, The older, smaller store stayed open during construction after being \"rolled back\" on the property to make room for the new building on the original location.

The Russellville Democrat In the 1870s, a group of affluent Russellville leaders, including Shinn, organized as the Russellville Printing and Publishing Association and established The Russellville Democrat , a weekly newspaper that assured its readers in its January 28, 1875, inaugural issue that \"it is placed on a firm basis and will be a permanent thing.\" Initially a weekly four-page newspaper, through consolidations and name changes, it evolved into a daily paper that today is The Courier .

Progress, competition, and the nature of steamboats and the river made this one of his more challenging endeavors. One boat was lost on August 16, 1875, when a steam boiler exploded. Another burned on April 1, 1881. Eventually, the construction of a floating bridge rendered his ferry obsolete. In 1877, a temporary injunction was granted in Shinn's favor restraining another business from Dardanelle from operating a competing ferry. Jacob Shinn bought out the entire interest of the other company the next year, eliminating the competition, The steam ferryboat Oasis , built in Little Rock, went into service between Dardanelle and Norristown in August 1878. A notice in The Russellville Democrat of September 30, 1880, announced that Shinn would \"soon start the steam ferry again between Dardanelle and Norristown.\" A month after the ferry burned in 1881, a contract had been let for it to be rebuilt according to the Russellville newspaper.

Shinn did grant D&RR the right to run across lands that he owned in Pope County. A 4.8-mile (7.7 km) shortline that still exists, D&RR runs from Russellville to the north bank of the Arkansas River at North Dardanelle , across from Dardanelle, Arkansas . D&RR train operations began on August 15, 1883. as did a ten-year contract between DR&R and Shinn for transportation of their freight and passengers over the river via the ferry. In 1882, a new ferryboat had been built in Little Rock. Another new steam ferryboat, Martha , at that time one of the largest in Arkansas and captained by Shinn's son, Edgar, was built in Murraysville, Ohio, and arrived at Dardanelle on September 26, 1883. Shinn's youngest son, Charles, also worked on the boat, which cost $20,000 to build. She was capable of operating during high flows, \"riding the mad waters in spite of the swift current and heavy driftwood,\" though her trips were less often than at low water. The crossing at Dardanelle was considered to be one of the hardest places to ferry from its source to its mouth.

The opening of the Dardanelle pontoon bridge in early 1891 rendered Shinn's ferry service obsolete. However, in April, the bridge washed away during high flows and flooding on the river. For a time, the ferry steamer Martha returned to service. First Christian Church Russellville's First Christian Church sits on land that was once owned by Shinn where the congregation had enjoyed picnics in a grove of trees. Shinn was a charter member and was selected, by lot, as one of the first deacons when the church was formally organized on January 29, 1882. The following September, the membership resolved to \"erect the very best edifice they can for the worship of God.\" The unassuming church building that exists to this day began as a single-story wooden structure built in 1885 after the congregation had met in the Masonic Hall for three years. After the construction loan was paid off, Jacob and Martha Shinn turned the deed to the property over to the congregation on February 28, 1889.

As an incentive for the move of the county seat to Russellville, Shinn and 15 other men provided a $50,000 bond for the construction of a new courthouse and jail within 12 months at no cost to the county or taxpayers on city center lots donated by Shinn. A similar bond was also offered by leaders in Atkins. Public school system Along with his other civic accomplishments, Shinn was a sponsor of the city's first public school system, donating sixteen lots and building a school. He was a member of the school board for many years up until his death. Melrose Cotton Mill Shinn was the president of the Melrose Manufacturing Company, established in 1882, which owned and operated a cotton mill one-quarter mile east of downtown Russellville that manufactured rope, twine, and yarn. While the mill operated for several years, interest accumulating on a large debt incurred by construction and equipment purchases consumed the plant's profits and sapped its financial strength. Shortages of fuel for the steam boiler and barrels for shipping its products of rope and twine halted operation several times. A fire in December 1888 destroyed machinery and products, completely halting production, though the mill was subsequently rebuilt and equipment replaced. In January 1891, a sale of the mortgage transferred ownership of the mill to parties outside of Arkansas, with the mill equipment eventually shipped to New Hampshire and many local citizens losing their investment.

Posting history The earliest Australian representation in Sweden dates to the appointment of a trade commissioner to Stockholm, which was first announced on 11 May 1958 with responsibility for promoting trade with Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland: \"the post would provide an important link in Australia\u2019s trade liaison with the Scandinavian countries, which had recently formed the Nordic Common Market and were an important factor in the discussions now taking place for the formation of a European Free Trade Area. The Stockholm post would ensure far more effective contact with those countries on trade developments in Europe, which were of vital importance to Australia.\" The first Australia trade commissioner in Stockholm, Bill Carney, took up office in December 1958. On 28 March 1961, the acting Minister for External Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick , announced that an Australian legation would be established in Sweden, absorbing the existing trade commissioner's office, with Carney assuming office as charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim from 15 June 1961. In November 1963, it was announced that the legation would be upgraded to the status of embassy, with the Australian Ambassador to the Soviet Union resident in Moscow appointed as the first ambassador to Sweden. On 27 September 1965, Bertram Ballard was appointed as the first resident ambassador to Sweden, and Ballard presented his credentials to King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden on 21 February 1966.

His next credited aerial victory took place the next day after he damaged another F-86, and during a later mission that day he was credited with shooting down an F-84. His next credited aerial victories were attacks on F-86 fighters in October. Later that month he attacked a B-29, causing damage that led to it losing control and fatally crashing while on approach to landing. Another credited victory that day was the downing of an F-84, although some sources indicate the aircraft suffered a compressor failure as cause of its crash. The last time Samoylov was officially credited with an aerial victory was on 4 November 1951, an incident indicated to have involved an F-86. Postwar historians credit him with an additional aerial victory on 5 January 1952 during a flight with Grigory Okhay in which he encountered an F-84, but there are no documents from his regiment supported the claim. Shortly after being made a flight commander in January 1952, he was made deputy commander of the 2nd squadron the next month. However, he did not hold that position for very long, since his regiment made its last sortie taking place on 20 February 1952 before being sent back to the USSR.

It was transformed from an Italian technical high school to a higher education institute offering graduate certification in each of its two sections, Architecture and Painting/Decoration. The institute became a school for Egyptian society's elites primarily Cairo's elite. Upper and upper middle class students with unique and independent approaches to their education who did not find an answer to their educational needs in the Egyptian high school system entered a special, individual, and nurturing environment in the institute. The institute had teachers and instructors, some of whom were from the old Italian traditional fascist era. Teachers escaping the turmoil in their homeland and others were purposely placed at this location by a hierarchy to protect and conserve their traditional treasures during turbulent times in Europe.

In Egypt, its first committees were born in Alexandria and in Cairo in 1896. During the first postwar period, the head office in Cairo started to promote and to teach Italian arts and literature to hundreds of students in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez. In the aftermath of World War II , the Dante Alighieri Institute restarted its activities and opened the Claudio Monteverdi Conservatoire.

History Kingdom of Burundi (1675\u20131894) The peoples with the longest history in the region were the Twa , who were known for pottery and hunting. Hutu people migrated to the area and engaged in farming. Waves of cattle-raising Tutsi moved south into the region from the fifteenth to sixteenth centuries. By 1625 all three groups were living in and interacting in the area. The Kingdom of Burundi developed under Ntare I of Burundi around 1675.

The mwami (king) ruled the area centered around Muramvya assisted by administrators. Chiefs administrated outlying districts and had autonomy to govern, within the framework of the kingdom. The socio-political hierarchy was headed by a king and a class of princes, known as ganwa , followed by attendants of the royal court, and other subjects of the middle and lower classes. Social hierarchy traced descent through the father, thus a child born to a Hutu father and Tsusi mother was Hutu. The place one occupied in the society was dependent on that of the paternal grandfather, regardless of the standing of the other three grandparents. Authority was secured through patronage , in which the king had power and influence over his subjects by offering them protection in exchange for loyalty and allegiance. Of feudal roots, the system was designed to maintain an inexpensive, pliable labor pool, which could be used to maximize production and limit costs, allowing a small elite class to monopolize wealth and power. The Rundi dynasty was plagued with conflict by the nineteenth century leading to difficulties in consolidating centralized power. The internal struggles led to enemies of Mwezi IV of Burundi aligning with the Germans in their attempts to oust Mwezi from power. The Germans were in the kingdom because of a personal initiative of Carl Peters . Unable to interest Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in his colonization scheme, Peters led the colonization efforts in East Africa by traveling through in 1884 and securing treaties with local sultans in Mbuzini, Nguru, Ukami, Usagara, and Useguha. Peters acquired twelve treaties with the sultans, which in exchange for protection against forces which might be a threat to their domain, granted him and his company the right to colonize, establish trade, and govern their territories.

In 1888, Peters secured an agreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar granting port concessions to German traders, which led to widespread revolt. In 1889, Germany began a military occupation of Burundi and in 1890, Peters turned over control of his colonization company to the German empire. In 1891 after the revolt was suppressed, the Reich declared its authority over the region. German East Africa (1894\u20131922) In 1894 the German government established German East Africa , which included parts of present-day Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania , as a formal colony under its protection. Urundi formally became a protectorate in 1903 when the Treaty of Kiganda was signed by Mwezi IV of Burundi and Friedrich Robert von Beringe . Under the terms of the German Colonial Act of 1888, German colonies were not part of the federal union , but they were also not considered foreign. Thus, laws that were extended to the colonies sometimes treated residents as nationals and other times as foreigners. German law applied to those subjects who had been born in Germany. Native subjects in the colonies were not considered to be German, but were allowed to naturalize. Naturalization required ten years residence in the territory and proof of self-employment. It was automatically bestowed upon all members of a family, meaning children and wives derived the nationality of the husband.

Three years after the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, Ruanda-Urundi became a League of Nations mandated territory , under the authority of Belgium. Belgian trust territory (1922\u20131962) The mandate for Ruanda-Urundi was established on 20 July 1922. For administrative purposes, Belgium assigned the administration of the territory to the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo . On 21 August 1925, the Belgian Parliament passed a Bill for the Government of Ruanda-Urundi, which stipulated that though administered by the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi was to be on an equal footing with the Congo and was to remain autonomous. With regard to the nationality of the inhabitants of the territory, the 1925 bill stipulated that Ruandan-Rundi natives were neither subjects, nationals, nor citizens of Belgium, but remained subjects of their respective native chiefs. Persons who were Belgian nationals domiciled in the colonies followed Belgian law, which required descent from a Belgian father and unity of nationality for members of a family. From 1932, a wife or child could refuse automatic acquisition of nationality by making a formal declaration. In the case of a wife, her declaration had to be made within six months of marriage and in the case of a child, before the age of twenty-three. The colonial administration transplanted tens of thousands of the inhabitants of Ruanda-Urundi to the North Kivu area of Belgian Congo to work on agricultural plantations and as miners.

From 1937 to the mid-1950s, under a program known as the Banyarwanda Immigration Mission ( French : Mission d'immigration des Banyarwanda ), forced migrations took place because of overpopulation and famine in Ruanda-Urundi. At the end of World War II the United Nations modified the mandates and established Trust Territories . Belgium continued to administrate Ruanda-Urundi from L\u00e9opoldville with separated institutions for Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. Initial plans were for Ruanda-Urundi to emerge from the trusteeship as a single state. To that end, a royal decree was issued on 14 July 1952 to reorganize the territory. Under its terms, the mwami remained hereditary and had the authority to appoint chiefs and petty chiefs, but the Governor-General had the right to veto his actions. Though the monarchy was changed by the decree, the mwami retained the power to issue laws to provide for governance and policing without democratic input from his subjects, however, he was bound to consult with the newly established native councils. When Congo gained independence in 1960, there was confusion regarding the status of the imported laborers from Ruanda-Urundi, which would remain an issue of conflict.

Post-independence (1962\u2013present) Under the constitution proclaimed on 23 November 1961, Burundi was established as a monarchy. The Constitution provided in Articles 4 and Article 5 that nationality and naturalization of foreigners were to be defined by law and until that law was drafted, those who were nationals were inhabitants born within the territory or abroad to a Murundi father. Those foreigners who had assimilated to the culture could naturalize and those who wished to repudiate their nationality could do so within two years if they had another nationality. Burundi gained its independence, effective 1 July 1962. A 1966 coup d'\u00e9tat , overthrew the monarchy and brought Michel Micombero to power as the first president of the Republic of Burundi. Two attempted coups occurred in 1969, followed by a violent uprising in 1972. The uprising caused mass exodus forcing many Murundi, to take refuge abroad. Under the 1971 Nationality Law (Law N\u00b0 1/93, 10 August), the first nationality codification of the country, many of these refugees who had taken foreign nationality so that they were able to work or have free movement to find work, lost their Burundian status because of prohibitions against dual nationality.

Husbands of Burundian women were required to naturalize. A palace revolution in 1976, ousted Micombero. A new constitution was drafted in 1981, but in 1987 Pierre Buyoya seized power, once again leading to violent unrest in the country. In 1991 a new constitution was drafted and approved by referendum the following year. A thwarted coup attempt occurred in 1993 and sparked a return in violence, which by 1994 had turned into civil war. Intervention by neighboring states, including Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda , resulted in the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreements being signed on 28 August 2000. That year, the Nationality Code was revised, but it retained gendered discrimination. Under the Nationality Code of 2000, dual nationality was allowed and persons who had formerly lost their nationality because they had acquired foreign status were able to retrieve Burundian nationality. An amendment to the requirements for naturalization was promulgated in 2003, adding conditions to show that applicants had sufficient ties to the country. According to professor and jurist Gerard Niyungeko , political unrest in the country meant that for 30 of the first 40 years of Burundi's independence, they were without a constitution. A new constitution based upon the Arusha Agreements was drafted and approved by a plebiscite held in early 2005.

Presently, 78 species of New World monkeys have been registered in South America. Around the middle of the Cenozoic, approximately 34 million years ago, two types of mammals appeared for the first time in South America: rodents and primates . Both of these groups had already been inhabiting other continents for millions of years and they simply arrived in South America rather than originated there. Analyses of evolutionary relationships have shown that their closest relatives were living in Africa at the time. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that they somehow crossed the Atlantic Ocean , which was less wide than today, landed in South America, and founded new populations of rodents and primates. The first South American primates gave rise to an impressive evolutionary radiation: more than 120 species in five families. These primates are known as platyrrhine (flat-nosed) primates and are closely related to Old World apes and monkeys ( catarrhine primates ). Platyrrhines include some of the most popular and acrobatic monkeys such as spider monkeys ( Ateles ) and capuchins ( Cebus ), both of which have grasping (prehensile) tails that can be used as a fifth limb. Platyrrhines also include a wide variety of colorful tamarins and marmosets (family Callitrichidae ).

The Kaga Domain was based at Kanazawa Castle in Kaga Province , in the modern city of Kanazawa , located in the Ch\u016bbu region of the island of Honshu . The Kaga Domain was ruled for its existence by the tozama daimy\u014d of the Maeda , and covered most of Kaga Province and Etch\u016b Province and all of Noto Province in the Hokuriku region . The Kaga Domain had an assessed kokudaka of over one million koku , making it by far the largest domain of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Kaga Domain was dissolved in the abolition of the han system in 1871 by the Meiji government and its territory was absorbed into Ishikawa Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture . History Maeda Toshiie was a distinguished military commander, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga and a close friend of Toyotomi Hideyoshi . A member of the Council of Five Elders who ruled Japan during the Sengoku period, he was granted the Kaga Domain in 1583. His eldest son, Maeda Toshinaga , supported Tokugawa Ieyasu in his rise to power and was rewarded by an increase in his lands to 1.25 million koku . Toshinaga was succeeded by his brother Maeda Toshitsune , who created two cadet branches of the clan: Toyama Domain (100,000 koku ), headed by descendants of Toshitsune's second son Toshitsugu (1617\u20131674", "source_type": "fixed"}

The name, which originally designated this specific location, came to be used by ancient sources as a general term for the Athenian popular court system , though modern English-language scholarship typically reserves \"Heliaia\" for the venue and uses \"dikasterion\" (pl. dikasteria ) for the institutional system. Etymology The noun heliaia derives from the Greek verb \u1f01\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( halizein ), meaning \"to gather people together.\" Fifth-century inscriptions render the word as \u1f10\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 ( eliaia ), without the initial eta (IG I\u00b3 40.70\u201376), reflecting its derivation from roots associated with assembly rather than from \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ( h\u0113lios , \"sun\"). Cognate terms appear across the Greek world. At Argos , \u1f01\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 ( haliaia ) designated the popular assembly. At Tegea in Arcadia, \u1f01\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af ( haliastai ) referred to a select body with political and judicial functions (IPArk 3.24\u201327). These Dorian parallels confirm that the term's root meaning concerns gathering or assembly, not sunlight \u2014 though the open-air character of Athenian court sessions may have reinforced the association. Meanings of the term In Classical Athens, the noun heliaia carried three related but distinct meanings: The institution: the body of 6,000 Athenian citizens ( \u1f21\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af , h\u0113liastai ) who swore the Heliastic Oath and were eligible to serve as jurors or, in the fourth century, as \u03bd\u03bf", "source_type": "fixed"}

Pol . 68.1) Modern scholarship typically uses dikasterion for the court system as an institution, reserving heliaia for the building or for contexts specifically involving the Heliastic Oath. Location The physical location of the Heliaia remains unknown. For several decades following excavations in the 1950s, a large unroofed rectangular enclosure at the southwestern corner of the Classical Agora was tentatively identified as the Heliaia. The excavator, Homer A. Thompson , acknowledged this was \"nothing more than a likely hypothesis\" given the absence of diagnostic material such as dikastic equipment. The identification appeared on site plans and became widely used, but uncertainty persisted. In the comprehensive 1995 publication of lawcourts in the Athenian Agora, the structure was designated simply as the \"Rectangular Peribolos\" \u2014 a neutral descriptive label avoiding any specific identification.

This reidentification has since been widely accepted and is reflected in current Agora Excavations publications. The search for the Heliaia's actual location continues. Literary sources indicate it was near or within the Agora, but no structure has been positively identified with it. The Heliaia and the court system Although \"Heliaia\" properly designates a venue, ancient sources \u2014 particularly orators addressing juries \u2014 sometimes used the term to refer to the popular court system generally. This metonymic extension was natural: the Heliaia was the largest and most prestigious venue, hosting the most important political trials, and the annual pool of 6,000 potential jurors swore the Heliastic Oath ( \u1f45\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) before becoming eligible to serve in any court. Modern scholarship distinguishes between: Heliaia : the specific venue (this article) Dikasterion (pl. dikasteria ): the institutional system of popular jury courts Dikastes (pl. dikastai ): the individual citizen-jurors The institutional development, procedures, and democratic functions of the court system are treated in the main article on the dikasterion . The Heliastic Oath Before serving in the annual pool of jurors, citizens swore the Heliastic Oath ( \u1f45\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ), named after this venue. The oath bound jurors to judge according to the laws and decrees of the Assembly and Council , or where no law existed, according to their own sense of justice ( \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u1fc3 ).

The oath was sworn annually. Its text is partially preserved through quotations in the orators, though no complete version survives. Relationship to other courts The Heliaia was one of several court venues in Athens, though it was the largest and handled the most significant cases. The popular courts (dikasteria) other than the Heliaia met in various locations around the Agora. The elaborate daily lottery system for assigning jurors to courts was designed in part to prevent advance knowledge of which venue would hear which case.

Polyaboloes were introduced by Martin Gardner in his June 1967 \" Mathematical Games column \" in Scientific American . Nomenclature The name polyabolo is a back formation from the juggling object ' diabolo ', although the shape formed by joining two triangles at just one vertex is not a proper polyabolo. By false analogy, treating the di- in diabolo as meaning \"two\", polyaboloes with from 1 to 10 cells are called respectively monaboloes, diaboloes, triaboloes, tetraboloes, pentaboloes, hexaboloes, heptaboloes, octaboloes, enneaboloes, and decaboloes. The name polytan is derived from Henri Picciotto's name tetratan and alludes to the ancient Chinese amusement of tangrams . Combinatorial enumeration There are two ways in which a square in a polyabolo can consist of two isosceles right triangles, but polyaboloes are considered equivalent if they have the same boundaries. The number of nonequivalent polyaboloes composed of 1, 2, 3, \u2026 triangles is 1, 3, 4, 14, 30, 107, 318, 1116, 3743, \u2026 (sequence A006074 in the OEIS ). Polyaboloes that are confined strictly to the plane and cannot be turned over may be termed one-sided. The number of one-sided polyaboloes composed of 1, 2, 3, \u2026 triangles is 1, 4, 6, 22, 56, 198, 624,", "source_type": "fixed"}

As for a polyomino , a polyabolo that can be neither turned over nor rotated may be termed fixed. A polyabolo with no symmetries (rotation or reflection) corresponds to 8 distinct fixed polyaboloes. A non-simply connected polyabolo is one that has one or more holes in it. The smallest value of n for which an n -abolo is non-simply connected is 7. Tiling rectangles with copies of a single polyabolo Tiling rectangles with polyaboloes. In 1968, David A. Klarner defined the order of a polyomino. Similarly, the order of a polyabolo P can be defined as the minimum number of congruent copies of P that can be assembled (allowing translation, rotation, and reflection) to form a rectangle . A polyabolo has order 1 if and only if it is itself a rectangle. Polyaboloes of order 2 are also easily recognisable. Solomon W. Golomb found polyaboloes, including a triabolo, of order 8. Michael Reid found a heptabolo of order 6. Higher orders are possible. There are interesting tessellations of the Euclidean plane involving polyaboloes. One such is the tetrakis square tiling , a monohedral tessellation that fills the entire Euclidean plane with 45\u201345\u201390 triangles. A polyabolo of order 20.

His studies at the universities of Bonn , Z\u00fcrich , and G\u00f6ttingen culminated in a Ph.D on \"Post-Archean Tectonics in Southern Central Sweden\". In 1935 he emigrated along with Korn to what was then South-West Africa (now Namibia ) (a former German colony) and worked as a consulting geologist. Namibia was at that time administered by its neighbor, South Africa and in 1939 South Africa, following the United Kingdom, declared war on Germany. In 1940, fearing internment as enemy aliens by the South African government, Martin and Korn decided to flee into the Namib desert and to wait out the war in the remote and rugged Kuiseb Canyon. They returned to Windhoek in 1942 after Korn developed beri-beri . They were not interned on their return and before the war ended were employed as surveyors by the government. In 1957 Martin wrote The Sheltering Desert , a memoir of his experiences while living in the Namib. The work was first published in German and has been translated into other languages. A 1992 film covers the story. Career Martin discovered the Messum crater in 1939, the Namibian remainder of a gigantic volcanic eruption that happened before Africa and South America broke apart.

He is known for having never been knocked down in any of his 93 professional bouts including fights against Muhammad Ali , Joe Frazier , and George Foreman . Chuvalo unsuccessfully challenged Muhammad Ali for the heavyweight championship in 1966. Chuvalo was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995. Early life and career Chuvalo was born on September 12, 1937, to Croat immigrants Stipan and Katica from Ljubu\u0161ki in the Herzegovina region of what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina . Chuvalo became the Canadian amateur heavyweight champion in May 1955, defeating Winnipeg 's Peter Piper with a first-round knockout (KO) in a tournament final in Regina, Saskatchewan . Chuvalo finished his amateur career with a 16\u20130 record, all by KO within four rounds. Originally nicknamed \"Boom Boom\", Chuvalo turned professional in 1956, knocking out four opponents in one night to win a heavyweight tournament held by former world champion Jack Dempsey at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on April 26, 1956. George Chuvalo's rankings as a heavyweight were: number 9 in 1963, number 5 in 1964, number 3 in 1965, number 8 in 1966, number 4 in 1968 and number 7 in 1970.

Parker, Yvon Durelle, Bob Cleroux , Willie Besmanoff, Mike DeJohn, Doug Jones, Bill Nielsen, Dante Cane, Joe Bygraves, Manuel Ramos, Jerry Quarry and Cleveland Williams. Some of his controversial losses on decision were to Bob Cleroux (twice), Floyd Patterson ( Ring Magazine Fighter of the Year), Ernie Terrell and Oscar Bonavena. His two draws against Alex Miteff and Tony Alongi were also controversial. In his defeats, Chuvalo failed to go the distance only in 1967 with Joe Frazier , and in 1970 with George Foreman . In both cases the referee stopped the fight while Chuvalo was still on his feet. He was also disqualified in 1961 against Joe Erskine (for headbutting - after complaining repeatedly about being fouled). Chuvalo holds the distinction of never being knocked down in his 93 professional bouts.

Personal life When Chuvalo was 21, he married 15 year old Lynne, with whom he had five children. Three of Chuvalo's sons, Jesse, Steven, and George Lee, were heroin addicts, which was introduced to the family by Jesse in 1984 after a severe motorbike accident led him to seek pain relief. The trio would often rob local pharmacies of prescription medication, for which they frequently served jail time. In February 1985, Jesse committed suicide, and over the next two months, Steven overdosed on heroin 15 times. In November 1993, less than a week after being released from prison for robbery, George Lee, who had survived a suicide attempt in prison and been threatening to intentionally overdose to reunite with Jesse, died of a heroin overdose.

Four days after George's death, Chuvalo's grief-stricken wife Lynne committed suicide on November 4. In August 1996, despite recent attempts at improving his life, including nearing completion on a degree in Russian Literature from Queen's University , Steven was found dead of a heroin overdose. Following his children's deaths, Chuvalo went into a deep depression. By the time of Steven's death, Chuvalo had also found himself in financial distress; the mortgage on his home had been foreclosed, and the contents of his house were being removed by creditors, although his economic situation improved over the following decades, due primarily to his giving speeches about his family's travails. Chuvalo's son Mitchell is a high school teacher, while daughter Vanessa manages a food market. Three months after Lynne's death, Chuvalo married his second wife, Joanne O'Hara, 20 years his junior, in January 1994. She already had two children from two previous relationships. Chuvalo's life, including the blows he had received in his boxing career, had taken a toll on his cognitive abilities. In 2018, a judge ruled that Chuvalo did not have the mental capacity to determine if he wished to reconcile with his wife after living apart for multiple years, and by 2022, he was suffering from advanced dementia. In 1998, Chuvalo was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada and in 2005 received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame .

An original hypothesis for the formation of chaos terrain on Mercury is an impact basin on the opposite side of the planet. However, there is some terrain on Mercury that has no connections to an impact basin, so this hypthesis does not fully explain Mercury's chaos terrain. A large portion of chaos terrain on Mercury is antipodal to the Caloris basin. They are the result of the ejecta and resurfacing caused by such a large impact. The chaotic terrain at the antipode of the Caloris Basin On Europa Chaos terrain is plentiful on Europa, covering between 20 and 40% of the surface. While many hypotheses have been proposed, none yet fully explains the origin of this terrain. On Europa, \"chaos terrain\" includes geological features such as chaos lenticulae, pits, spots, and domes. Chaos terrain has been observed at both a higher and lower altitude than surrounding non-chaos terrain but is most often uplifted from nearby topography. Nearly all observed chaos terrain lies on top of its surroundings, indicating chaos terrain is a relatively young feature on Europa.

Fresh chaos terrain is very young and has not been crosscut by other geological features. Modified chaos terrain is older, with smoother edges and crosscutting features. A possible origin of the lenticulae on Europa's surface is the strong gravitational pull of Jupiter. As the surface is stretched and squished, the surface may crack and pull apart, or be pushed together. Another potential origin of various chaos terrain on Europa is interactions between the icy surface and liquid ocean under Europa's surface. Warm water plumes can melt the surface of Europa, and then movements of the shell can move chaos terrain to a different location than where it was formed. On Pluto Chaos terrain on Pluto is not as well understood as that on other bodies. On Pluto, chaos terrain is referred to most often as \"Montes\" and are likely made up mostly of water ice, which at the temperature of Pluto's surface acts as bedrock. Additionally, at Pluto's temperature, nitrogen ice is not able to form the tall topographical features we observe around the Sputnik basin , further proving water ice as the main component of the montes formations. Most of the montes on Pluto are on the outside edges of Sputnik Planitia, a giant impact basin. The cause of this is the uplift and disruption due to the high-energy impact. Causes The specific causes of chaos terrain are not yet well understood. A number of different astrogeological forces have been offered as causes of chaos terrain. On Europa, impact events and subsequent penetration into a ductile or liquid crust were suggested in 2004. In November 2011, a team of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and elsewhere presented evidence in the journal Nature suggesting that many \"chaos terrain\" features on Europa sit atop vast lakes of liquid water. These lakes would be entirely encased in the moon's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice", "source_type": "fixed"}

These lakes would be entirely encased in the moon's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. Rather than an external impact, the authors propose a four-step model for producing the surface expressions (chaos terrain) and the shallow, covered lakes. Full confirmation of the lakes' existence will require a space mission designed to probe the ice shell either physically or indirectly, for example using radar. On Mars, chaos terrain is believed to be associated with the release of huge amounts of water . The chaotic features may have collapsed when water came out of the surface. Martian rivers begin with a chaos region. In 2018, radar studies from the Mars Express mission detected evidence of subglacial lakes beneath Mars' south polar region, supporting the idea that underground water may contribute to the formation of chaos terrain. A chaotic region can be recognized by a rat's nest of mesas, buttes, and hills, chopped through with valleys which in places look almost patterned. Some parts of this chaotic area have not collapsed completely\u2014they are still formed into large mesas, so they may still contain water ice. Chaotic terrain occurs in numerous locations on Mars, and always gives the strong impression that something abruptly disturbed the ground. Chaos regions formed long ago. By counting craters (more craters in any given area means an older surface) and by studying the valleys' relations with other geological features, scientists have concluded the channels formed 2.0 to 3.8 billion years ago. Scientists have thought of different ideas for the cause of chaotic terrain. One explanation for the source of the water that quickly left the ground and created chaos is that water rich sediment was deposited in giant canyons on the floor of an ocean. Later, when the ocean disappeared, the sediments froze. If hot magma came near to the region, the ice", "source_type": "fixed"}

Later, when the ocean disappeared, the sediments froze. If hot magma came near to the region, the ice would have melted and formed large underground river systems. When these neared the surface, huge amounts would break out of the ground and carve the valleys we see today. There is much evidence for an ocean on Mars. Places have been photographed that could be where the ground collapsed when water left subterranean rivers to flow out of chaotic regions. One of the first hypotheses for the source of the water was based on old Viking Orbiter pictures. It was thought that these outflows came from a global cryosphere-confined aquifer that collected water from south polar meltwater. The cryosphere would have formed during the Hesperian period in the planet's history into the planet's upper crust. One chaotic terrain, Galaxias Chaos may be caused by sublimation of an ice-rich deposit. This series of drawings show another model for the formation of Martian chaos, as proposed by Pedersen and Head, 2011. Amount of sublimation is exaggerated to improve understanding.

As owner of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror , he was an early developer of popular journalism, and he exercised vast influence over British popular opinion during the Edwardian era . Lord Beaverbrook said he was \"the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street .\" About the beginning of the 20th century there were increasing attempts to develop popular journalism intended for the working class and tending to emphasize sensational topics. Harmsworth was the main innovator. Lord Northcliffe had a powerful role during the First World War , especially by criticizing the government regarding the Shell Crisis of 1915 . He directed a mission to the new ally, the United States, during 1917, and was director of enemy propaganda during 1918. His Amalgamated Press employed writers such as Arthur Mee and John Hammerton , and its subsidiary, the Educational Book Company, published The Harmsworth Self-Educator , The Children's Encyclop\u00e6dia , Harmsworth Popular Science , and Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia . Challenging the dominance in popularity of the \" penny dreadfuls \" among British children, from the 1890s Harmsworth half-penny periodicals, such as Illustrated Chips , would enjoy a virtual monopoly of comics in the UK until the emergence of DC Thomson comics in the 1930s.

Wells was at school with him at the time and encouraged Harmsworth to start the school magazine. In 1880 he first visited the Sylvan Debating Club , founded by his father, and of which he later served as Treasurer. Beginning as a freelance journalist, he initiated his first newspaper, Answers (original title: Answers to Correspondents ), and was later assisted by his brother Harold , who was adept in business matters. Harmsworth had an intuitive sense for what the reading public wanted to buy, and began a series of cheap but successful periodicals, such as Comic Cuts (tagline: \"Amusing without being Vulgar\") and the journal Forget-Me-Not for women. From these periodicals, he developed the largest periodical publishing company in the world, Amalgamated Press . His half-penny periodicals published in the 1890s played a role in the decline of the Victorian penny dreadfuls . Harmsworth was an early developer of popular journalism. He bought several failing newspapers and made them into an enormously profitable news group, primarily by appealing to the general public. He began with The Evening News during 1894, and then merged two Edinburgh papers to form the Edinburgh Daily Record . That same year he funded an expedition to Franz Joseph Land in the Arctic with the intention of making attempts to travel to the North Pole. On 4 May 1896, he began publishing the Daily Mail in London, which was a success, having the world record for daily circulation until Harmsworth's death; taglines of the Daily Mail included \"the busy man's daily journal\" and \"the", "source_type": "fixed"}

Harmsworth then transformed a Sunday newspaper, the Weekly Dispatch , into the Sunday Dispatch , then the greatest circulation Sunday newspaper in Britain. He also initiated the Harmsworth Magazine (later London Magazine 1898\u20131915), utilizing one of Britain's best editors, Beckles Willson , who had been editor of many successful publications, including The Graphic . During 1899, Harmsworth was responsible for the unprecedented success of a charitable appeal for the dependents of soldiers fighting in the South African War by inviting Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Sullivan to write the song \" The Absent-Minded Beggar \". Harmsworth also initiated The Daily Mirror during 1903, and rescued the financially desperate The Observer and The Times during 1905 and 1908, respectively.

In 1906, Harmsworth was raised to the peerage as Baron Northcliffe , of the Isle of Thanet in the County of Kent . The peerage was requested by King Edward VII , and was alleged to have been purchased. It remains a matter of speculation. He is reported to have joked that when he wanted a peerage he would buy one, \"like an honest man.\" In 1918, Harmsworth was created Viscount Northcliffe , of St Peter's in the County of Kent, for his service as the director of the British war mission in the United States. Marriage Alfred Harmsworth married Mary Elizabeth Milner on 11 April 1888. She was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) and Dame of Grace, Order of St John (D.St.J) during 1918. They did not have any children together. Children Lord Northcliffe had four acknowledged children by two different women. The first, Alfred Benjamin Smith, was born when Harmsworth was seventeen years old; the mother was a sixteen-year-old maidservant in his parents' home. Smith died during 1930, allegedly in a mental home. By 1900, Harmsworth had acquired a new mistress, an Irishwoman named Kathleen Wrohan, about whom little is known but her name; they had two further sons and a daughter, and she died in 1923.

That meant that in an era before radio, television or internet, Northcliffe dominated the British press \"as it never has been before or since by one man\". Northcliffe's editorship of the Daily Mail in the years just before the First World War in which the newspaper displayed \"a virulent anti-German sentiment\" caused The Star to declare, \"Next to the Kaiser, Lord Northcliffe has done more than any living man to bring about the war\". His newspapers, especially The Times , reported the Shell Crisis of 1915 with such zeal that it helped to end the Liberal government of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith , which forced Asquith to form a coalition government (the other causal event was the resignation of Admiral Fisher as First Sea Lord ). Northcliffe's newspapers propagandized for creating a Minister of Munitions , which was held first by David Lloyd George , and helped to bring about Lloyd George's appointment as prime minister in 1916. Lloyd George offered Northcliffe a job in his cabinet, but Northcliffe refused and was instead appointed director for propaganda. Northcliffe had used his newspapers to criticise the British government's lack of readiness for what he perceived to be the German threat. On 25 February 1917, a German warship shelled Northcliffe's country house Elmwood located near the Kent coast in an attempt to assassinate him. His former residence still bears a shell hole out of respect for his gardener's wife, who was killed in the attack.

Northcliffe's enemies accused him of power without responsibility, but his papers were a factor in settling the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, and his mission to the United States, from June through to October 1917, has been judged successful by historians. Northcliffe's personality shaped his career. He was monolingual and not well-educated and knew little history or science. He had a lust for power and for money, while leaving the accounting paperwork to his brother Harold. He imagined himself Napoleon reborn and resembled the emperor physically and in terms of his enormous energy and ambition. Above all, he had a boyish enthusiasm for everything. Norman Fyfe , an intimate friend, described him: Boyish in his power of concentration upon the matter of the moment, boyish in his readiness to turn swiftly to a different matter and concentrate on that.... Boyish the limited range of his intellect, which seldom concerns itself with anything but the immediate, the obvious, the popular. Boyish his irresponsibility, his disinclination to take himself or his publications seriously; his conviction that whatever benefits them is justifiable, and that it is not his business to consider the effect of their contents on the public mind.

Monument to Northcliffe at St Dunstan-in-the-West Lord Northcliffe's health declined during 1921 due mainly to a streptococcal infection . His mental health collapsed; he acted like a madman but historians say it was a physical malady. He went on a world tour to revive himself, but it failed to do so. He died of endocarditis in his London house, No. 1 Carlton House Gardens , on 14 August 1922. He left three months' pay to each of his six thousand employees. The viscountcy, barony, and baronetcy of Northcliffe became extinct. A monument to Northcliffe at St Dunstan-in-the-West , Fleet Street, London, was unveiled in 1930. The obelisk was designed by Edwin Lutyens and the bronze bust is by Kathleen Scott . His body was buried at East Finchley Cemetery in North London. Legacy Historian Ian Christopher Fletcher states: Northcliffe's drive for success and respectability found its main outlet in the commercial world of journalism, not the political world the parties and parliaments. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment, underlying the relentless acquisition of newspapers and perfection of their \"copy\", was the simple incorporation of millions of readers into his press empire.

Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure conclude that: More than anyone ... shaped the modern press. Developments he introduced or harnessed remain central: broad contents, exploitation of advertising revenue to subsidize prices, aggressive marketing, subordinate regional markets, independence from party control. According to Piers Brendon : Northcliffe's methods made the Mail the most successful newspaper hitherto seen in the history of journalism. But by confusing gewgaws with pearls, by selecting the paltry at the expense of the significant, by confirming atavistic prejudices, by oversimplifying the complex, by dramatizing the humdrum, by presenting stories as entertainment and by blurring the difference between news and views, Northcliffe titillated, if he did not debouch, the public mind; he polluted, if he did not poison, the wells of knowledge. The A. Harmsworth Glacier in North Greenland was named by Robert Peary in his honour. (Northcliffe had provided a ship for the expedition.) Northcliffe lived for a time at 31 Pandora Road, West Hampstead; this site is now marked with an English Heritage blue plaque. Cultural depictions Northcliffe was the subject of a number of fictionalized portrayals. One of the earliest was the character of Mr. Whelpdale in George Gissing 's 1891 novel New Grub Street . Whelpdale publishes a magazine called Chit-Chat (similar to Northcliffe's Answers ), which is aimed at \"the quarter-educated; that is to say the great new generation that is being turned out by the Board Schools, the young men and women who can just read, but are incapable of sustained attention\".

Fagan 's 1910 play The Earth features a satirical version of Northcliffe, Sir Felix Janion, who uses sexual blackmail to prevent the passing of a bill which would provide a minimum wage for his employees. Promotion of Group Settlement Scheme Throughout his newspaper career Northcliffe promoted the ideas which resulted in the Group Settlement Scheme . The scheme promised land in Western Australia to British settlers prepared to emigrate and develop the land. A town founded specifically to assist the new settlements was named Northcliffe , in recognition of Lord Northcliffe's promotion of the scheme.

After nine soldiers from the division died in the collapse of a farm building on 21 February 2005, an incident officially blamed on an insurgent-fired rocket-propelled grenade, Surovikin publicly promised to \"destroy three insurgents for every soldier killed,\" in spite of the policy that required insurgents to be handed over to authorities. Investigation by independent news organization Novaya Gazeta revealed that the deaths were caused by the accidental discharge of a grenade launcher by drunk soldiers. In an April interview with army newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda , Surovikin complained that rules of engagement, especially the requirement to detain suspected militants instead of shooting them, hindered counter-insurgency operations, and that Chechen fighters were exploiting Russian soldiers' hesitation to fire on insurgents near civilians. For his rhetoric, he gained a reputation in the press as a tough commander with an \"iron fist.\" In June, Surovikin ordered the Borozdinovskaya cleansing operation to \"search for and detain insurgents,\" in which soldiers of the division's Vostok Battalion burned down houses, beat 87 civilians, killed one elderly man, and abducted eleven civilians. Surovikin categorically denied that the abductions took place, but the company commander responsible was convicted of abuse of power. Senior command roles Returning from Chechnya, Surovikin was appointed deputy commander of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army in Voronezh in November 2005, rising to serve as its chief of staff from May 2006 and army commander from April 2008.

On 28 December 2017, he was made a Hero of the Russian Federation for his leadership of the Group of Forces in Syria. Under his command, a significant turning point in the fight against the Syrian opposition was achieved. The Syrian Government regained over 50% control of Syria by the end of 2017 after a string of successful military campaigns. According to several Russian military commentators, it was Surovikin who turned the tide of the war. Surovikin took command of the contingent of Russian military forces in Syria again from January to April 2019. Altogether he commanded the Russian forces group in Syria for more than a year, which was longer than any other officer until November 2020, when Lieutenant General Aleksandr Chaiko surpassed his duration in that post. An October 2020 Human Rights Watch report listed Surovikin as one of the commanders \"who may bear command responsibility for violations\" during the 2019\u20132020 offensive in Idlib, Syria . In 2021, Surovikin was promoted to General of the Army .

This caused the U.S. intelligence community to reassess their estimated likelihood that Russia would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine from 5-10% to 50% in the case that Russian lines in the south collapsed.

It was located on top of the Stratosphere Tower , Las Vegas , Nevada , which is the tallest free-standing observation tower in the United States . The coaster was manufactured by S&MC GmbH Structures and Machines. History View of Las Vegas from the High Roller The ride opened on April 29, 1996, in a special VIP gala opening, one day before the ride and casino opened to the general public. High Roller was one of the first two amusement rides to open on the Stratosphere tower at the casino opening (the other being Big Shot ). Even initially, Stratosphere guests exhibited considerably greater excitement over the Big Shot gravity drop tower than they did over High Roller. As with the other rides at the Stratosphere Las Vegas, admission to the High Roller was typically charged per ride, as opposed to a single pass that allowed for unlimited rides as is typically the case in most United States amusement parks. The cost to ride the High Roller was $5 per rider in 2001 (barring residency and other discounts). This price was later lowered to $4. Closure and removal High Roller was closed on December 30, 2005, and dismantled. The ride was in need of refurbishing that would cost over $500,000 and was the least popular of the Stratosphere rides, leading to the decision to remove it. It was initially estimated that removal of the ride would take three months and be accomplished largely by crane, but the use of plasma cutting , as opposed to gas cutting , sped the removal of the coaster (the lack of need to transport flammable acetylene canisters for gas cutting also improved safety).

The 300 lb (140 kg) track segments were also removed by elevator as opposed to being removed by crane. Ride experience The High Roller sat high on top of the tower's observation pod and its track wound around the central mast. Due to these design limitations, the High Roller was neither a fast nor intense ride experience; the height alone was the primary thrill element. The height of the ride itself from base to top was quite modest, only having a drop of 20 feet (6.1 m). Some writers described the ride as being bumpy while the coaster banks sharply around the tower. While it seemed to riders that there was nothing between the track and the Las Vegas Strip below, a platform was present underneath the ride. The ride garnered generally poor reviews from its riders. For example, it was ranked as the 8th most overrated roller coaster by About.com 's Arthur Levine, who criticized High Roller for its low speed and acceleration, as well as its lack of drops and inversions. Aggregated reviews on themeparkcritic.com gave the ride an average of 2.77 out of 5.0, compared to Stratosphere's other rides\u2014 Big Shot , X-Scream and Insanity \u2014which all garnered ratings above 4.0 out of 5.0. Although there were never any serious incidents or injuries on the High Roller, the ride was well known for its frequent break-downs, and all the rides on Stratosphere would frequently shut down temporarily due to high winds (greater than 45 mph).

The story in the film contains references to many of the characters in the book series, with some of their descendants occupying key roles in the plot. The original score was composed by Trevor Jones . This score is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Geoffrey Alexander. The miniseries premiered as installments of The Wonderful World of Disney from May 12\u201314, 2002, on ABC . It received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special . It was soon followed by a television series , which failed to achieve the relative success miniseries itself.

Crabb leads the boys to a village, where the boys are surprised to see that they are wearing clothes from different cultures in different time periods. There, they witness a young Dinotopian woman, Marion Waldo, pacify a Ankylosaurus with a toothache. The two boys befriend her and hitch a Brachiosaur \"bus\" ride to Waterfall City. During the journey, the \"Brachs\" become distressed by an unseen presence. Marion, David, Karl and the Brach bus conductor investigate the forest nearby and find Tyrannosaurus footprints. Marion is unsettled by this, as Tyrannosaurus do not usually hunt in packs. She begins to sense a strange unbalance, after discovering the destroyed remains of a Dinotopian village. For the Brachs's safety, the group spends the night in the village. Later in the night, the group is attacked by the raiding Tyrannosaurus pack. Karl, David and Marion run for their lives, as the Tyrannosaurus hunt them down. Marion trips and falls, and is nearly killed by a Tyrannosaurus when a group of Skybax riders, humans riding on Quetzalcoatlus , distract and scare away the Tyrannosaurus . The Skybax squadron leader, Oonu, offers to escort the Brachs to Waterfall.

As Karl and David prepare to take their places in their new surroundings, both boys develop a strong bond with young Marion, who is on the verge of becoming a \"matriarch\" of the Dinotopian society. Legend has it that their ancestors lived in an underworld that was lit by sunstones. Cyrus has been stealing artifacts and books to try and find a way off the island. Zipeau discovers all the stolen items, but Cyrus knocks him out and throws him in a water canal. Meanwhile, Karl finds a Dino egg and gets sent on a mission by himself.

Production Plans for a film based on Dinotopia were previously rejected due to the expense of creating a world populated by both humans and dinosaurs. Both Columbia Pictures and Disney at one time made the attempt, but both studios abandoned the idea, with Disney opting to make its own homegrown film, Dinosaur in 2000. Hallmark Entertainment CEO Robert Halmi Sr. then purchased the rights after having read the books. Halmi was willing to spend $80 million on the film, despite the lukewarm performance of his previous fantasy miniseries, The Tenth Kingdom . ABC had so much confidence in the miniseries that they began shooting episodes of the spin-off television series before the miniseries had aired. More than 75% of the scenes in the miniseries required visual effects, many of which required interaction between the live-action human actors and the animatronic or computer-animated dinosaurs. The animated dinosaurs were created by a London-based company, Framestore CFC , who also did the CGI work for the Walking with Dinosaurs series. The series also used other visual effects techniques such as digital set extensions. Many of the sets were only partially built, the rest being done digitally, to create the enormous buildings used by both dinosaurs and humans in the film. Even so, the actual set for Waterfall City, Dinotopia's capital, took up five-and-a-half acres of the back lot of England's Pinewood Studios .

The album title comes from lines in the choruses of both \"Fire - Part 1\" and \"Freak Like You.\" The band began a world tour in September 2018 in support of the album. Critical reception The album has received a score of 81 on review aggregator Metacritic , based on reviews from six critics. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, and said that while \" Kiss This \" was the band's \"first notable achievement, their second LP advances the notion that maybe ignoring the last 30 or 40 years of pop trends isn't the best approach\". Hermes highlighted the style of frontman Luke Spiller, calling \"Ashes (Part 2)\" \"a cross between a Bat Out of Hell outtake and hairmetal Maroon 5 \". He also deemed \"Body Talks\" the \"Kiss This\" of the album, calling it \"an over the top chant-pop anthem that's winning on first listen, irritating soon after\", saying that even \"if it fails to be more than the sum of its 'woo!'s, it's still effective, and gets bonus points for the remix with Kesha \". The song \"Bulletproof Baby\" is featured on EA Sports ' video game NHL 19 . The song \"One Night Only\" was used in a tribute video by the Pittsburgh Penguins to honor Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in his first game at PPG Paints Arena since his trade in June of 2017.

His most notable and contested work is Red Action, which he staged after he attended the June Forth vigil held annually in Victoria Park in Hong Kong in 1995.

Some consider it as \"the most famous political stunt in Hong Kong history\". Early life and education Pun was a participant of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. A photograph of him going on a hunger strike during the protests was featured on the cover of Le tremblement de terre de P\u00e9kin , a 1991 book about the uprising written by French authors Michel Bonnin, Jean-Philippe B\u00e9ja, and Alain Peyraube.

For Pun, vandalising the statue represents an act of reclaiming agency, an opportunity to reject colonial culture, even if the Chinese went in great number to exploit the colony, considering the low quality life from China, and to challenge the values that the statue symbolises in \"a period of colonial domination.\" In an interview with Mariana Wan in the South China Morning Post , Pun offered the following rationale for his performance: \"I smashed this statue. The message is loud and clear: I am saying no to colonial culture. I do not hold anything against Queen Victoria personally. What I am against is the era the statue represents; an era of colonialism. A lot of people do not know why this statue is in the park. Or if they know they are not aware of its significance . . . In Hong Kong, nobody thinks hard on the significance of the statue of Queen Victoria. A lot of artists and people said they had fond feelings towards this statue; that as children, they had played under it. This I find very strange. I don\u2019t know whether that is due to the fact that Hong Kong has neglected its education on historical and cultural matters . . . A museum is a perfect place for it so that people, the future generations, can reflect on the history of Hong Kong. Not a park.\" The performance received negative reactions although it has been considered as a significant artistic act demanding democracy. Artist and art critic Leung Po Shan Anthony argued that this act evoked fear among Hong Kong people of the Cultural Revolution and the prospect of future Communist rule. It was criticized as an \"outdated act of resistance\" by nationalism against colonialism, and it highlighted a \"severe divergence\" in the emotional fabric between the people of Mainland China and Hong Kong.

Basidiocarps are effused, corticioid , smooth, and pinkish and grow on wood. The fungus is a commercially significant plant pathogen which has become a serious problem, especially in Brazil . Erythricium salmonicolor causes Pink Disease, most commonly in Citrus , although E. salmonicolor has a wide host range including rubber and cacao trees. Pink Disease causes branch and stem die-back due to canker formation. The cankers are recognizable by gum exudation and longitudinal splitting of the bark. Hosts and symptoms Erythricium salmonicolor has a very broad host range. The host plants of greatest importance include rubber, tea , coffee , cacao, grapefruit , orange , nutmeg , mango , apple , coca , and kola . Pink Disease can cause heavy losses including individual branch death to the loss of the whole tree in cases where the main stem or several branches are affected. E. salmonicolor causes girdling cankers which prevent the normal function of some physiological processes, eventually leading to defoliation and die-back of outer branches. On rubber trees, initial stages of infection appear as drops of latex and silky-white mycelial growth on the bark surface. In black pepper plants, sterile pink to white pustules approximately 1 mm in diameter appear on young green stems. In citrus trees, sterile pustules may appear first, and in some cases the trees may have oozing sap or gum. In cacao trees, first symptoms of infection usually present as a sparse white mycelium on the bark surface, which can be easily overlooked. Trees are most susceptible in areas with high levels of rainfall, such as tropical rainforests .

Trees are most susceptible in areas with high levels of rainfall, such as tropical rainforests . Diagnosis of Pink Disease is typically achieved through the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to observe sporulation of the pathogen. Management and control Management of E. salmonicolor and Pink Disease can be very difficult given its wide host range, making cross-infection a concern. Cultural control can be implemented by pruning frequently and burning any infected branches removed. This is effective when the disease can be recognized in the earliest stages, but it is most effective when performed concurrently with fungicide application. The encrustation and conidial pustules are able to remain functional for a period of time after the infected branches have been removed from the tree. Fungicide use varies among countries affected by the disease. In India , pre- and post- monsoon application of fungicides directly on the trunk and branches of cocoa or rubber trees effectively prevented the disease, while application of a sulphur-lime slurry to tea shrubs worked best in Kalimantan in Borneo , and Validamycin A was found to be the most effective means of control on rubber trees in Vietnam . The use of fungicides prevents the basidiospores from germinating and causing infection. Importance Erythricium salmonicolor is of particular importance in areas such as Colombia , China , or Thailand that rely on the export of globally important crops like coffee, tea, or rubber respectively. In cocoa, there have been reported losses of 80% or more in Western Samoa . Young trees are particularly affected by the disease, as Pink Disease typically does not kill mature trees it infects. in citrus trees in Brazil, E. salmonicolor has been shown to be responsible for reduction of citrus production by up to 10%.

There have been multiple accusations of Pakistan\u2019s military establishment rigging the election in favor of General Ayub Khan. There were two major parties contesting the elections: the Convention Muslim League and the Combined Opposition Parties . The Combined Opposition Parties consisted of five major opposition parties, and had a nine-point program, which included the restoration of parliamentary democracy and introduction of direct elections and adult franchise. The Combined Opposition Parties had no single leadership and were therefore, unable to select a presidential candidate from amongst themselves. Hence, they chose Fatima Jinnah as their candidate who was seen as an undisputed leader due to her relationship with Muhammad Ali Jinnah . Meanwhile, the candidate for Convention Muslim League was the incumbent President Mohammed Ayub Khan . Election campaign There were four candidates: General Ayub Khan, Fatima Jinnah and two independent candidates, K.M. Kamal and Mian Bashir Ahmed. There was a short campaigning period of one month, which was further restricted to nine projection meetings that were organized by the Election Commission and were attended only by the members of the Electoral College and members of the press. The public was barred from attending the projection meetings, which would have enhanced Fatima Jinnah's image. Ayub Khan Since then, he had been serving as a president. He consolidated his position as a Constitutional ruler by drafting the 1962 constitution .

He didn't even hesitate to legislate on electoral matters, giving him an edge over rival candidate, Fatima Jinnah. Fatima Jinnah The campaign of Fatima Jinnah suffered from a number of setbacks. An unfair and unequal election campaign, poor finances, and indirect elections through the Basic Democracy System were some of the primary problems she faced. However, she had overwhelming support among the public. Many had sympathies with her as she was the sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah , whilst others saw her as an excellent figure to challenge Ayub Khan's Military Dictatorship. Although many clerics had denounced her with the view that a woman cannot lead a Muslim state, several religious leaders also supported her. The Jamaat-e-Islami led by Maududi , was a keen supporter of Ms. Jinnah's campaign as she was a conservative motivated by religious views, as compared to secular Ayub Khan. Results and aftermath The election results came in favour of the incumbent President Ayub Khan, who, despite losing the popular vote, won 62.43% of the Electoral vote. Fatima Jinnah won 35.86% of the electoral college votes. Jinnah was however extremely successful in some areas of the country. She had swept across major urban centres such as Karachi and Dhaka .

It began in earnest in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius , and was largely completed in the southern half of Britain (most of what is now called England and Wales ) by AD 87, when the Stanegate was established. The conquered territory became the Roman province of Britannia . Following Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain in 54 BC, some southern British chiefdoms had become allies of the Romans . The exile of their ally Verica gave the Romans a pretext for invasion. The Roman army was recruited in Italia , Hispania , and Gaul and used the newly-formed fleet Classis Britannica . Under their general Aulus Plautius , the Romans pushed inland from the southeast, defeating the Britons in the Battle of the Medway . By AD 47, the Romans held the lands southeast of the Fosse Way . British resistance was led by the chieftain Caratacus until his defeat in AD 50. The isle of Mona , a stronghold of the druids , was attacked in AD 60 . This was interrupted by an uprising led by Boudica , in which the Britons destroyed Camulodunum , Verulamium and Londinium . The Romans put down the rebellion by AD 61. The conquest of Wales lasted until c. AD 77 . Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola conquered much of northern Britain during the following seven years. In AD 84, Agricola defeated a Caledonian army, led by Calgacus , at the Battle of Mons Graupius . However, the Romans soon withdrew from northern Britain.

After Hadrian's Wall was established as the northern border, tribes in the region repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and forts continued to be maintained across northern Britain to protect against these attacks. Background Southern British tribes before the Roman invasion In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, British tribes had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar 's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC , and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age , especially in the south. Between 55 BC and the 40s AD, the status quo of tribute, hostages, and client states without direct military occupation, begun by Caesar's invasions of Britain, largely remained intact. Augustus prepared invasions in 34 BC, 27 BC and 25 BC. The first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire, the second because the Britons seemed ready to come to terms. According to Augustus's Res Gestae , two British kings, Dubnovellaunus and Tincomarus , fled to Rome as supplicants during his reign, and Strabo 's Geographica , written during this period, says Britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered. By the 40s AD, the political situation within Britain was in ferment. The Catuvellauni had displaced the Trinovantes as the most powerful kingdom in south-eastern Britain, taking over the former Trinovantian capital of Camulodunum ( Colchester ). The Atrebates tribe whose capital was at Calleva Atrebatum ( Silchester ) had friendly trade and diplomatic links with Rome and Verica was recognised by Rome as their king, but Caratacus ' Catuvellauni conquered the entire kingdom some time after AD 40 and Verica", "source_type": "random"}

Caligula may have planned a campaign against the Britons in AD 40, but its execution was unclear: according to Suetonius ' The Twelve Caesars , he drew up his troops in battle formation facing the English Channel and, once his forces had become quite confused, ordered them to gather seashells , referring to them as \"plunder from the ocean due to the Capitol and the Palace \". Alternatively, he may have told them to gather \"huts\", since the word musculi was also soldier's slang for engineers' huts and Caligula himself was very familiar with the Empire's soldiers. In any case this readied the troops and facilities that would make Claudius' invasion possible three years later. For example, Caligula built a lighthouse at Bononia (modern Boulogne-sur-Mer ), the Tour d'Ordre , that provided a model for the one built soon after at Dubris (Dover). Preparations for the invasion under Claudius In 43, possibly by reassembling Caligula's troops from 40, Claudius mounted an invasion force under overall charge of Aulus Plautius , a distinguished senator. A pretext of the invasion was to reinstate Verica , the exiled king of the Atrebates . It is unclear how many legions were sent: only the Legio II Augusta , commanded by future emperor Vespasian , was directly attested to have taken part.

Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known from the sources to have been involved in the invasion. Cassius Dio mentions Gnaeus Hosidius Geta , who probably led the IX Hispana , and Vespasian's brother Titus Flavius Sabinus the Younger . He wrote that Sabinus was Vespasian's lieutenant, but as Sabinus was the older brother and preceded Vespasian into public life, he could hardly have been a military tribune . Eutropius mentions Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus , although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later. Crossing and landing Campaigns under Aulus Plautius and the British tribes The main invasion force under Aulus Plautius crossed in three divisions. The port of departure is usually taken to have been Bononia ( Boulogne ), and the main landing at Rutupiae ( Richborough , on the east coast of Kent ). Neither of these locations is certain. Dio does not mention the port of departure, and although Suetonius says that the secondary force under Claudius sailed from Boulogne it does not necessarily follow that the entire invasion force did. Richborough had a large natural harbour, which would have been suitable, and archaeology shows Roman military occupation at about the right time.

River battles British resistance was led by Togodumnus and Caratacus , sons of the late king of the Catuvellauni, Cunobeline . A substantial British force met the Romans at a river crossing thought to be near Rochester on the River Medway . The Battle of the Medway raged for two days. Gnaeus Hosidius Geta was almost captured, but recovered and turned the battle so decisively that he was awarded the Roman triumph . At least one division of auxiliary Batavian troops swam across the river as a separate force. The British were pushed back to the Thames . They were pursued by the Romans across the river, causing some Roman losses in the marshes of Essex . Whether the Romans made use of an existing bridge for this purpose or built a temporary one is uncertain. Togodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for Claudius to join him for the final push. Cassius Dio presents this as Plautius needing the emperor's assistance to defeat the resurgent British, who were determined to avenge Togodumnus. However, Claudius was no military man. The Praetorian cohorts accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in AD 43. The Arch of Claudius in Rome says he received the surrender of eleven British kings with no losses, and Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars says that Claudius received the surrender of the Britons without battle or bloodshed.

Cassius Dio relates that he brought war elephants and heavy armaments which would have overawed any remaining native resistance, though the claim Claudius brought elephants to Britain has been doubted by modern historians, and may refer to a military machine, perhaps a siege tower , instead. Eleven tribes of South East Britain surrendered to Claudius and the Romans prepared to move further west and north. The Romans established their new capital at Camulodunum and Claudius returned to Rome to celebrate his victory. Caratacus escaped with his family, retainers, and treasure, to continue his resistance further west. After the invasion, Verica may have been restored as king of the Atrebates although by this time he would have been very elderly. In any case a new ruler for their region, Cogidubnus , soon appeared as his heir and as king of a number of territories following the first stage of the conquest as a reward as a Roman ally.

That this line is followed by the Roman road of the Fosse Way has led many historians to debate the route's role as a convenient frontier during the early occupation. It is unlikely that the border between Roman and Iron Age Britain was fixed with modern precision during this period. Late in 47 the new governor of Britain, Publius Ostorius Scapula , began a campaign against the tribes of modern-day Wales , and the Cheshire Gap . The Silures of southeast Wales caused considerable problems to Ostorius and fiercely defended their border country. Caratacus himself led this guerilla campaign but was defeated when he finally chose to offer a decisive battle ; he fled to the Roman client tribe of the Brigantes who occupied the Pennines . Their queen Cartimandua was unable or unwilling to protect him however, given her own accommodation with the Romans, and handed him over to the invaders. Ostorius died and was replaced by Aulus Didius Gallus who brought what are now the Welsh borders under control but did not move further north or west, probably because Claudius was keen to avoid what he considered a difficult and drawn-out war for little material gain in the mountainous terrain of upland Britain. When Nero became emperor in 54, he seems to have decided to continue the invasion and appointed Quintus Veranius as governor, a man experienced in dealing with the troublesome hill tribes of Anatolia . Veranius and his successor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus mounted a successful campaign across North Wales, famously killing many druids when he invaded the island of Anglesey in 60.

Conquests to the North The casus belli presented itself in 69 when Cartimandua queen of the Brigantes following a rebellion by her husband Venutius was forced to ask the Romans for aid, who evacuated her leaving Venutius in power. About Venutius one speculation is that he might have been a Carvetian and may therefore have been responsible for the incorporation of Cumbria into a Brigantian federation whose territory straddled Britain along the Solway - Tyne line; furthermore Cartimandua may have ruled the Brigantian peoples east of the Pennines (possibly with a centre at Stanwick , Yorkshire), while Venutius was the chief of the Brigantes west of the Pennines (or Carvetii), in Cumbria (with a possible centre based at Clifton Dykes ). In any case Tacitus says that in 71 Cerialis (governor AD 71\u201374) waged a successful war against the Brigantes . He praises both Cerialis and his successor, Julius Frontinus (governor 75\u201378). Much of the conquest of the north may have been achieved under the governorships of Vettius Bolanus (governor AD 69\u201371), and of Quintus Petillius Cerialis .

Nevertheless, Gnaeus Julius Agricola played his part in the west as commander of the legion XX Valeria Victrix (71\u201373), while Cerialis led the IX Hispania in the east. In addition, the Legio II Adiutrix sailed from Chester up river estuaries to surprise the enemy. The western thrust was started from Lancaster , where there is evidence of a Cerialian foundation, and followed the line of the Lune and Eden river valleys through Low Borrow Bridge and Brougham ( Brocavum ). On the Cumbrian coast, Ravenglass and Blennerhasset were probably involved from evidence of one of the earliest Roman occupations in Cumbria. Beckfoot and Maryport may also have featured early on. At some point between 72 and 73, part of Cerialis's force moved across the Stainmore Pass from Corbridge westwards to join Agricola, as evidenced by campaign camps (which may have been previously set up by Bolanus) at Rey Cross , Crackenthorpe, Kirkby Thore and Plumpton Head. Signal- or watch-towers are also in evidence across the Stainmore area: Maiden Castle, Bowes Moor and Roper Castle, for example.

During his tenure, he probably established the fort at Pumsaint in west Wales, largely to exploit the gold deposits at Dolaucothi . He left the post in 78, and was later appointed water commissioner in Rome. Campaigns of Agricola (AD 78\u201384) Agricola's campaigns The new governor was Agricola, returning to Britain, and made famous through the highly laudatory biography of him written by his son-in-law, Tacitus . Arriving in mid-78, Agricola completed the conquest of Wales in defeating the Ordovices who had destroyed a cavalry ala of Roman auxiliaries stationed in their territory. Knowing the terrain from his prior military service in Britain, he was able to move quickly to subdue them. He then invaded Anglesey , forcing the inhabitants to sue for peace. The following year he moved against the Brigantes of northern England and the Selgovae along the southern coast of Scotland, using overwhelming military power to establish Roman control.

In 82, he sailed to either Kintyre or the shores of Argyll , or to both. In 83 and 84, he moved north along Scotland's eastern and northern coasts using both land and naval forces, campaigning successfully against the inhabitants and winning a significant victory over the northern British peoples led by Calgacus at the Battle of Mons Graupius . Archaeology has shown the Romans built military camps in the north along Gask Ridge , controlling the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands , and also throughout the Scottish Lowlands in northeastern Scotland. Agricola built a network of military roads and forts to secure the Roman occupation. Existing forts were strengthened and new ones planted in northeastern Scotland along the Highland Line , consolidating control of the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands . The line of military communication and supply along southeastern Scotland and northeastern England (i.e., Dere Street ) was well-fortified. In southernmost Caledonia, the lands of the Selgovae (approximating to modern Dumfriesshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ) were heavily planted with forts, not only establishing effective control there, but also completing a military enclosure of south-central Scotland (most of the Southern Uplands , Teviotdale , and western Tweeddale ).

Clay-domed ovens and 26 fire pits dated to AD 77\u201390 were also found, loaded with burnt objects and charcoal contents. The fire pits were 30 metres (98 feet) apart in two parallel lines.

It is equally likely that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was more profitable to leave the Caledonians alone and only under de jure submission.

The period from 87 to 117 was used for consolidation and only a few sites north of the Stanegate line were maintained, while the signs are that an orderly withdrawal to the Solway-Tyne line was made. Modifications to the Stanegate line, with the reduction in the size of the forts and the addition of fortlets and watchtowers between them, seem to have taken place from the mid-90s onwards. Apart from the Stanegate line, other forts existed along the Solway Coast at Beckfoot, Maryport , Burrow Walls (near the present town of Workington) and Moresby (near Whitehaven). Other forts in the region were built to consolidate Roman presence (Beckfoot for example may date from the late 1st century). A fort at Troutbeck may have been established from the period of Emperor Trajan ( r. 98\u2013117) onwards.

Following his defeat of the Brigantes in 139 AD, Quintus Lollius Urbicus , the Roman Governor of Britannia , was ordered by Antoninus Pius to march north of Hadrian's Wall to conquer the Caledonian Lowlands which were settled by the Otadini , Selgovae , Damnonii and the Novantae , and to push the frontier further north. Lollius Urbicus moved three legions into position initially establishing his supply routes from Coria and Bremenium and moved three legions, the Legio II Augusta from Caerleon , the Legio VI Victrix from Eboracum , and the Legio XX Valeria Victrix from Deva Victrix into the theatre between 139 and 140 AD, and thereafter moved his army, a force of at least 16,500 men, north of Hadrian's Wall. The Selgovae , having settled in the regions of present-day Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire immediately northwest of Hadrian's Wall, were amongst the first of the Caledonian tribes to face Lollius Urbicus's legions together with the Otadini . The Romans, who were well versed in warfare on hilly terrain since their founding, moved quickly to occupy strategic points and high ground, some of which had already been fortified by the Caledonians with hill forts .

He used the three legions of the British garrison (augmented by the recently formed 2nd Parthica legion), 9000 imperial guards with cavalry support, and numerous auxiliaries supplied from the sea by the British fleet, the Rhine fleet and two fleets transferred from the Danube for the purpose. According to Dio Cassius , he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics before having to withdraw to Hadrian's Wall.

This is the first recorded utterance confidently attributable to a native of the area now known as Scotland. The emperor Septimius Severus died at York while planning to renew hostilities, and these plans were abandoned by his son Caracalla . Emperor Constantius came to Britain in 306, despite his poor health, with an army aiming to invade northern Britain, after the provincial defences had been rebuilt following the Carausian Revolt . Little is known of his campaigns with scant archaeological evidence, but fragmentary historical sources suggest he reached the far north of Britain and won a major battle in early summer before returning south. His son Constantine (later Constantine the Great ) spent a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the Picts beyond Hadrian's Wall in the summer and autumn. Later excursions into Scotland by the Romans were generally limited to the scouting expeditions of exploratores in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The degree to which the Romans interacted with the Goidelic -speaking island of Hibernia (modern Ireland ) is still unresolved amongst archaeologists in Ireland.

Dihedral angle has a strong influence on dihedral effect , which is named after it. Dihedral effect is the amount of roll moment produced in proportion to the amount of sideslip . Dihedral effect is a critical factor in the stability of an aircraft about the roll axis (the spiral mode ). It is also pertinent to the nature of an aircraft's Dutch roll oscillation and to maneuverability about the roll axis. Longitudinal dihedral is a comparatively obscure term related to the pitch axis of an airplane. It is the angle between the zero-lift axis of the wing and the zero-lift axis of the horizontal tail. Longitudinal dihedral can influence the nature of controllability about the pitch axis and the nature of an aircraft's phugoid -mode oscillation.

The term can also apply to the wings of a bird . Dihedral angle is also used in some types of kites such as box kites. Wings with more than one angle change along the full span are said to be polyhedral . Dihedral angle has important stabilizing effects on flying bodies because it has a strong influence on the dihedral effect. Dihedral effect of an aircraft is a rolling moment resulting from the vehicle having a non-zero angle of sideslip . Increasing the dihedral angle of an aircraft increases the dihedral effect on it. However, many other aircraft parameters also have a strong influence on dihedral effect. Some of these important factors are: wing sweep , vertical center of gravity , and the height and size of anything on an aircraft that changes its sidewards force as sideslip changes. Longitudinal dihedral Dihedral angle on an aircraft almost always implies the angle between two paired surfaces, one on each side of the aircraft . Even then, it is almost always between the left and right wings . However, mathematically dihedral means the angle between any two planes. So, in aeronautics, in one case, the term \"dihedral\" is applied to mean the difference in angles between two front-to-back surfaces: Longitudinal dihedral is the difference between the angle of incidence of the wing root chord and angle of incidence of the horizontal tail root chord. Longitudinal dihedral can also mean the angle between the zero-lift axis of the wing and the zero-lift axis of the horizontal tail instead of between the root chords of the two surfaces.

This measurement is also often referred to as decalage . History In geometry, dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. Aviation usage differs slightly from usage in geometry. In aviation, the usage \" di hedral\" evolved to mean the positive, up angle between the left and right wings, while usage with the prefix \"an-\" (as in \" an hedral\") evolved to mean the negative, down angle between the wings. The aerodynamic stabilizing qualities of a dihedral angle were described in an influential 1810 article by Sir George Cayley . Uses of dihedral angle and dihedral effect Aircraft stability analysis In analysis of aircraft stability, the dihedral effect is also a stability derivative called C l \u03b2 {\\displaystyle \\beta } meaning the change in rolling moment coefficient (the \" C l \") per degree (or radian) of change in sideslip angle (the \" \u03b2 {\\displaystyle \\beta } \"). Provision of stability The purpose of dihedral effect is to contribute to stability in the roll axis. It is an important factor in the stability of the spiral mode which is sometimes called \"roll stability\". The dihedral effect does not contribute directly to the restoring of \"wings level\", but it indirectly helps restore \"wings level\" through its effect on the spiral mode of motion described below. Wing clearance Aircraft designers may increase dihedral angle to provide greater clearance between the wing tips and the runway. This is of particular concern with swept-wing aircraft, whose wingtips could otherwise hit the runway on rotation/touchdown.

(Examples range from the early deHavilland DH-4 biplane to the modern Airbus A380 jetliner.) In military aircraft dihedral angle space may be used for mounting materiel and drop-tanks on wing hard points, especially in aircraft with low wings. The increased dihedral effect caused by this design choice may need to be compensated for, perhaps by decreasing the dihedral angle on the horizontal tail. Using dihedral angle to adjust dihedral effect During design of a fixed-wing aircraft (or any aircraft with horizontal surfaces), changing dihedral angle is usually a relatively simple way to adjust the overall dihedral effect. This is to compensate for other design elements' influence on the dihedral effect. These other elements (such as wing sweep, vertical mount point of the wing, etc.) may be more difficult to change than the dihedral angle. As a result, differing amounts of dihedral angle can be found on different types of fixed-wing aircraft. For example, the dihedral angle is usually greater on low-wing aircraft than on otherwise-similar high-wing aircraft. This is because \"highness\" of a wing (or \"lowness\" of vertical center of gravity compared to the wing) naturally creates more dihedral effect itself. This makes it so less dihedral angle is needed to get the amount of dihedral effect needed. Common confusions Dihedral effect is defined simply to be the rolling moment caused by sideslip and nothing else. Rolling moments caused by other things that may be related to sideslip have different names. Dihedral effect is not caused by yaw rate , nor by the rate of sideslip change . Since dihedral effect is noticed by pilots when \"rudder is applied\", many pilots and other near-experts explain that the rolling moment is caused by one wing moving more quickly through the air and one wing less", "source_type": "random"}

Since dihedral effect is noticed by pilots when \"rudder is applied\", many pilots and other near-experts explain that the rolling moment is caused by one wing moving more quickly through the air and one wing less quickly. Indeed, these are actual effects, but they are not the dihedral effect, which is caused by being at a sideslip angle, not by getting to one. These other effects are called \"rolling moment due to yaw rate\" and \"rolling moment due to sideslip rate\" respectively. Dihedral effect is not roll stability in and of itself. Roll stability is less-ambiguously termed \"spiral mode stability\" and dihedral effect is a contributing factor to it. How dihedral angle creates dihedral effect and stabilizes the spiral mode The dihedral angle contributes to the total dihedral effect of the aircraft. In turn, the dihedral effect contributes to stability of the spiral mode . A stable spiral mode will cause the aircraft to eventually return to a nominally \"wings level\" bank angle when the angle of the wings is disturbed to become off-level. Fig. 1: Uncompensated lift component produces a side force F y , which causes the aircraft to sideslip. Fig. 2: Non-zero sideslip sets the lower, upwind wing to a higher angle of attack, resulting in stabilising roll moment P. The aircraft is shown flying directly towards the viewer. If a disturbance causes an aircraft to roll away from its normal wings-level position as in Figure 1, the aircraft will begin to move somewhat sideways toward the lower wing. In Figure 2, the airplane's flight path has started to move toward its left while the nose of the airplane is still pointing in the original direction. This means that the oncoming air is arriving somewhat from the left of the nose. The airplane now has sideslip angle in addition to the bank angle. Figure ", "source_type": "random"}

This means that the oncoming air is arriving somewhat from the left of the nose. The airplane now has sideslip angle in addition to the bank angle. Figure 2 shows the airplane as it presents itself to the oncoming air. How dihedral angle creates rolling moment from sideslip (dihedral effect) In Figure 2, the sideslip conditions produce greater angle of attack on the forward-yawed wing and smaller angle of attack on the rearward-yawed wing. This alteration of angle of attack by sideslip is visible in Figure 2. As greater angle of attack produces more lift (in the usual case, when the wing is not near stalling), the forward wing will have more lift and the rearward wing will have less lift. This difference in lift between the wings is a rolling moment, and it is caused by the sideslip. It is a contribution to the total dihedral effect of the aircraft. How dihedral effect stabilizes the spiral mode The rolling moment created by the sideslip (labeled as \"P\") tends to roll the aircraft back to wings level. More dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the \"leveling\" direction more strongly, and less dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the \"leveling\" direction less strongly. Dihedral effect helps stabilize the spiral mode by tending to roll the wings toward level in proportion to the amount of sideslip that builds up. It is not the whole picture however. At the same time that angle of sideslip is building up, the vertical fin is trying to turn the nose back into the wind, much like a weathervane, minimizing the amount of sideslip that can be present. If there is no sideslip, there can be no restoring rolling moment. If there is less sideslip, there is less restoring rolling moment. Yaw stability", "source_type": "random"}

If there is no sideslip, there can be no restoring rolling moment. If there is less sideslip, there is less restoring rolling moment. Yaw stability created by the vertical fin opposes the tendency for dihedral effect to roll the wings back level by limiting sideslip. The spiral mode is the tendency to slowly diverge from, or the tendency to slowly return to wings level. If the spiral mode is stable, the aircraft will slowly return to wings-level, if it is unstable, the aircraft will slowly diverge from wings-level. Dihedral effect and yaw stability are the two primary factors that affect the stability of the spiral mode, although there are other factors that affect it less strongly. Other factors contributing to dihedral effect The CG of a paraglider is very low, making a strong contribution to dihedral effect Factors of design other than dihedral angle also contribute to dihedral effect. Each increases or decreases total aircraft dihedral effect to a greater or lesser degree. Sweepback Wing sweepback also increases the dihedral effect, for roughly 1\u00b0 of effective dihedral with every 10\u00b0 of sweepback. This is one reason for anhedral configuration on aircraft with high sweep angle, as well as on some airliners, even on low-wing aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-134 and Tu-154 . In any case, wing sweepback can also occur with a dihedral configuration. For instance, two small biplanes produced from the 1930s to 1945 by B\u00fccker Flugzeugbau in Germany, the B\u00fccker Jungmann two-seat trainer and the B\u00fccker Jungmeister aerobatic competition biplane , were designed with sweepbacks of approximately 11 degrees, which provided significant dihedral effect \u2013 in addition to their small dihedral angles having a similar but lesser effect.

Vertical position of the center of mass The center of mass , usually called the center of gravity or \"CG\", is the balance point of an aircraft. If suspended at this point and allowed to rotate, a body (aircraft) will be balanced. The front-to-back location of the CG is of primary importance for the general stability of the aircraft, but the vertical location has important effects as well. The vertical location of the CG changes the amount of dihedral effect. As the \"vertical CG\" moves lower, dihedral effect increases. This is caused by the center of lift and drag being further above the CG and having a longer moment arm. So, the same forces that change as sideslip changes (primarily sideforce, but also lift and drag) produce a larger moment about the CG of the aircraft. This is sometimes referred to as the pendulum effect . An extreme example of the effect of vertical CG on dihedral effect is a paraglider . The dihedral effect created by the very low vertical CG more than compensates for the negative dihedral effect created by the strong anhedral of the necessarily strongly downward curving wing. Wing location The wing location on a fixed-wing aircraft will also influence its dihedral effect. A high-wing configuration provides about 5\u00b0 of effective dihedral over a low-wing configuration. Effects of too much dihedral effect A side effect of too much dihedral effect, caused by excessive dihedral angle among other things, can be yaw-roll coupling (a tendency for an aircraft to Dutch roll ).

Anhedral and polyhedral Anhedral Anhedral on the wings and tailplane of an RAF Harrier GR7A . Front view of an Antonov An-124 . The anhedral wings are clearly seen. Military fighter aircraft often have near zero or even anhedral angle reducing dihedral effect and hence reducing the stability of the spiral mode. This increases maneuverability which is desirable in fighter-type aircraft. Anhedral angles are also seen on aircraft with a high mounted wing, such as the very large Antonov An-124 and Lockheed C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft. In such designs, the high mounted wing is above the aircraft's center of gravity which confers extra dihedral effect due to the pendulum effect (also called the keel effect ) and so additional dihedral angle is often not required. Such designs can have excessive dihedral effect and so be excessively stable in the spiral mode, so anhedral angle on the wing is added to cancel out some of the dihedral effect so that the aircraft can be more easily maneuvered.

Others, such as the Vought F4U Corsair , used an inverted gull wing design, which allowed for shorter landing struts and extra ground clearance for large propellers and external payloads, such as external fuel tanks or bombs. Modern polyhedral wing designs generally bend upwards near the wingtips (also known as tip dihedral ), increasing dihedral effect without increasing the angle the wings meet at the root, which may be restricted to meet other design criteria. Polyhedral is seen on gliders and some other aircraft. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is one such example, unique among jet fighters for having dihedral wingtips. This was added after flight testing of the flat winged prototype showed the need to correct some unanticipated spiral mode instability \u2013 angling the wingtips, which were already designed to fold up for carrier operations, was a more practical solution than re-engineering the entire wing.

He became particularly known for his role as a treaty partner of the German colonial administration. He likely died in German captivity in connection with the genocide of the Nama and Herero . The only known specimen of this prominent Nama leader is held in the Archive of the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory . Background The Topnaar are a community of the Nama people who traditionally lived along the Kuiseb River and in the vicinity of Walvis Bay . During German colonial rule in German South West Africa (from 1884), representatives of the German government and trading companies sought treaty relations with local chiefs to legitimize their claims to land and influence. Role in Colonial History Jan Uixamab was one of the signatories of so-called protection treaties concluded between German colonial representatives and local leaders. These treaties granted the German Empire formal control over various territories. In historical documents, Uixamab is mentioned in connection with a Declaration on a Cocoa Field , which he signed together with the Nama leader Cornelius Zwartboy . Significance The signing of such treaties by Jan Uixamab and other local leaders marks an early phase of German colonial policy in South West Africa. This phase later transitioned into violent suppression of the indigenous population.

They are smoky in flavor, and can be soft or very dry in texture depending on freshness. Typically, they are quite long, 60 cm (24 in), but very thin, with a diameter around 1 cm ( 1 \u2044 2 in), and folded in two, giving them a characteristic appearance. Versions made of chicken and turkey are staples in kosher meat markets and delicatessens . Etymology and history The name comes from the word kaban , an old obsolete term used in eastern parts of Poland for a young male pig fattened with potatoes specially for making this kind of sausage (hence kabanos , 'made of kaban '). The word kaban with a similar meaning is also present in other neighbouring languages; it was initially loaned from Turkic languages where it denotes a boar (compare Tatar : kaban , Azerbaijani : qaban , Kazakh : \u049b\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d , cognate with Turkish : yaban ). Kabanosy are known to have been produced since medieval times at least, and because of their long-lasting capabilities they were considered perfect food for soldiers and travellers, which is reflected by kabanos ' design traits: thinness, usually very extended length, and shape in which they are always kept. According to some historians, they were hung around the neck like a necklace, allowing horsemen to eat on the go without stopping for a food break. For the same reason, they were also used as hiking food and are very common among Gorals .

For the same reason, they were also used as hiking food and are very common among Gorals . Tighter, smaller wraps of long kabanosy \u2014 as sold nowadays \u2014 were also common among foot soldiers (and travellers). Smaller kabanos wrapping allowed it to be \"worn\" on a wrist and eaten while marching. Nowadays, kabanosy are made using different spices, and come in many different flavours. Before the 20th century, various spices were also being used in the production of kabanosy , giving them locally distinct tastes, which differed between various regions of Poland. Modern times Production of kabanosy requires a minimum of 150 grams (5.3 oz) of best grade pork meat to make 100 grams (3.5 oz) of sausage, which is known today as the \"minimum of 3:2 ratio\". This is required because of the loss of some of the water contained within the meat used to prepare the raw sausage, which evaporates during the long process of meat smoking. Nowadays almost every Polish manufacturer of kabanosy describes on the packaging at which ratio their sausage was made; for example, the manufacturer Kania states that \"157 grams of meat was used to make 100 grams of kabanosy \". The two main types of kabanosy include a slightly \"softer\" and more common type (smoked much less, just for the taste), and a \"harder\" type (much drier than the softer ones), which are smoked for a very long time, basically until bending the sausage becomes difficult (to the point that it cracks when someone attempts to bend it). Because of the long and thorough smoking process, the \"harder\" kabanos type is extremely long-lasting and does not spoil as quickly as most other meats without preservatives. Furthermore, kabanosy are also categorized into two other main types, depending on the amount of spices used: \"hot", "source_type": "random"}

Both \"harder\" and \"softer\" types of kabanosy come in \"hot\" or \"mild\", since the \"hardness\" of the sausage comes only from the length of its smoking time, but otherwise the two are made of the same ingredients. According to modern recipes, kabanosy are seasoned with different spices, such as black pepper , chili , and others. Unlike other meats, these sausages are typically eaten alone as an appetiser or are often served with cheese. Although kabanosy can be cooked with other food, they are usually served cold only. Only if no other meat were available to Polish travelers or soldiers would they then have sliced kabanos into small pieces to cook them with vegetables, buckwheat , millet , potatoes, or whatever else was available. Some manufacturers have created sausages made with the same process as kabanosy , but have substituted the traditional pork with other meat (mainly poultry). Due to their distinct shape and look, they are often called kabanosy , too, with the addition of the name of the meat they contain, such as kabanosy z kurczaka , 'chicken kabanosy '.

In 2011, when Polish manufacturers submitted scientific proofs of kabanos ' Polish origins, the EU registered Kabanosy staropolskie as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed on request of Poland .

Frigates of the period were three-masted, full-rigged ships that carried their main battery on a single, continuous gun deck . They were smaller and faster than ships of the line and primarily intended for raiding, reconnaissance and messaging. Since late 1778, those of 36 or 38 guns with a main armament of 18-pounder (8.2 kg) long guns , had become the standard in the Royal Navy and by 1793, when the French Revolutionary War began, it was not unusual for them to be close to 1000 tons burthen (bm) . Rule's original Amazon class were 32-gun, 12-pounder , frigates of 677 tons builder's old measurement (bm), built between 1771 and 1782. In need of a larger frigate, in 1794, the Admiralty asked for a 36-gun, 18-pounder version. The new class of ship was to be 143 ft (44 m) along the gundeck , 119 ft 6 in (36 m) at the keel , with a beam of 38 ft 2 in (12 m) and a depth in hold of 13 ft 6 in (4 m); making it 925 87 \u2044 94 bm.

The new vessels would also have eight 32-pounder (14.5-kilogram) carronade ; two on the forecastle and six on the quarterdeck. Carronades were lighter so could be manoeuvred with fewer men, and had a faster rate of fire but had a much shorter range than the long gun.

Profile plan for Trent and her sister ship Glenmore The first two, HMS Amazon and Emerald were ordered on 24 May 1794, and were to be built of oak . The second pair, HMS Trent and Glenmore were ordered on 24 January 1795 but these were to be constructed of pitch pine . The shortage of timber, and in particular oak, was a constant problem for the Royal Navy in the 18th and 19th centuries. Softwoods were easier to work and did not require as much seasoning so fir-built frigates could be produced quicker. They were not as strong however, and did not last as long as their oak-built counterparts. Being lighter, they floated higher in the water, unless additional ballast was added, and this made them faster, although with a tendency to fall to leeward . The Trent and Glenmore were identical in design to the hardwood ships except for the stern which was built with a square tuck.

HMS Emerald First commissioned for Admiral John Jervis 's fleet in the Mediterranean . In 1797, Emerald was one of several vessels sent to hunt down and capture the Spanish flagship Santisima Trinidad , which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent . A four-decker, carrying 130 guns, the Santisima Trinidad was the world's largest warship of the time. Crippled during the battle, she had been towed to safety. Emerald was supposed to have been present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson 's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth 's squadron during the action of 7 April 1800 off C\u00e1diz . Emerald served in the Caribbean throughout 1803 in Admiral Samuel Hood 's fleet, then took part in the invasion of St Lucia in July, and of Surinam the following spring. Returning to home waters for repairs in 1806, she served in the Western Approaches before joining a fleet under Admiral James Gambier in 1809, and taking part in the Battle of the Basque Roads .

They returned to duty when Admiral Adam Duncan's flagship came alongside and threatened to open fire. When Duncan sailed to meet the Dutch fleet, Trent was one of only four loyal ships that went with him, and kept the enemy in port by making signals to a fleet that did not exist. In November, Trent sailed for the Leeward Islands where, on 30 March 1799, she and the 10-gun cutter HMS Sparrow captured a Spanish ship and schooner in a cutting out expedition off Puerto Rico . Two other schooners were scuttled by their Spanish crews during the battle. In October 1800, while serving in the Channel, Trent ' s crew took part in another boat action when they boarded a cutter and a lugger off the Ile de Brehat . Trent spent her last years as a fifth rate, in the West Indies . She returned home in June 1803, to be fitted as a hospital ship .

The dispute was resolved on 16 May and Glenmore was reassigned to the Irish station . While there, Glenmore played a part in suppressing the Irish Rebellion of 1798 ; her crew taking part in a boat action against rebel outposts near Wexford . While escorting a large convoy to the West Indies in December 1799, Glenmore and another frigate, Aimable , encountered two French vessels, French frigate Sir\u00e8ne and French corvette Berg\u00e8re , and the recently captured East Indiaman Calcutta . After a 35-minute engagement, Amiable had driven off the French warships while Glenmore recaptured Calcutta . During a refit at Plymouth in March 1800, the naval architect Robert Seppings introduced, as an experiment, diagonal trusses that reduced hogging. Glenmore was subjected to another mutiny in May 1801, precipitated by a change of captain . The new commander was not popular, a much stricter disciplinarian who ordered up to five times as many floggings as his predecessor, and the crew felt that most of the punishments were excessive or unwarranted. Two of the ringleaders were court-martialled and hanged the following October. Three others stood trial but were released after the charge was not proven. Glenmore continued to serve on the Irish Station until the Treaty of Amiens was ratified in March 1802, after which she served as a troopship for soldiers returning from the continent.

The SVT is a stand-alone amplifier or \"head\" as opposed to a \"combo\" unit comprising amp and speaker(s) in one cabinet, and was capable of 300 watts output at a time when most amplifiers could not exceed 100 watts output, making the SVT an important amp for bands playing music festivals and other large venues. The SVT has been through many design changes over the years but is still in production today. While the SVT could be used with any 300 watt , 2- or 4-ohm cabinet combination, Ampeg recommended that it be used with a pair of sealed 8x10\" speaker enclosures because one cabinet could not handle the power of the SVT. It was not until 1980 that the speakers in the enclosures were updated to a power handling rating of 350 watts, allowing a player to use an SVT head with only one cabinet. SVT originally stood for Super Vacuum Tube , but Ampeg has since revised the meaning of the initialism to Super Valve Technology , with the word \"valve\" referring to the vacuum tubes (called \"valves\" in Britain and some other regions) used in the amp. History Following Unimusic's acquisition of Ampeg in 1967, the new company management was actively pursuing the rock market, opening offices in Chicago, Nashville, and Hollywood, and developing products designed to address the needs of rock musicians. When The Rolling Stones began rehearsing for their 1969 U.S. Tour in Hollywood, a power conversion failure blew up all of their UK Fender amplifiers. Their road manager, Ian Stewart contacted Rich Mandella at the Ampeg office in Hollywood, and Rich arranged for the band to use five prototype high-output amplifier heads of a", "source_type": "random"}

Their road manager, Ian Stewart contacted Rich Mandella at the Ampeg office in Hollywood, and Rich arranged for the band to use five prototype high-output amplifier heads of a new model being developed by Bill Hughes and Roger Cox. These new amps employed a 14-tube design to generate 300 watts of power in an era when most tube amps generated less than 100. The Rolling Stones took these prototype Ampeg amps on tour along with Rich Mandella, playing all guitars and basses through them for the entire tour. After the tour, Ampeg put the SVT into production, introducing it at the NAMM Show in 1969. Ampeg SVT Classic (black face & grill) Types There are three types of original SVT amps. The first are the \"blue line\" SVTs, so named after the blue screen printing that surrounds the tone controls. Early 1969-70 \"blue lines\" used 6146B beam power vacuum tubes in the output stage, which proved unstable and was switched to the more robust, reliable and commonly used 6550 tube around mid-1970. The second version of a vintage SVT is what is called the \"black line\" SVT, earning its name from the black (rather than blue) faceplate screen printing. Like the later-revision \"blue lines\" models, the \"black line\" SVTs utilize 6550 power vacuum tubes instead of 6146Bs. Later 1970s models have the same features as the \"black line\" SVTs, except the lines around the tone controls have rounded corners and curve into the tone controls. Additionally, these models included 3-prong power cables, and did not include a polarity switch. In the early 1980s, Ampeg was bought by Music Technologies, Inc.

In the early 1980s, Ampeg was bought by Music Technologies, Inc. (MTI), which contracted to have SVTs manufactured in Japan. While MTI-era SVTs are mostly identical to the previous versions, they did have differences. Cosmetically, MTI SVTs have black faceplates with white lettering, black grill cloth, \"elephant hide\" or rougher textured tolex, and rack case-style spring-loaded handles, updated from the previous (and painful) rubber-covered metal strap handles. These SVTs also include a back panel selector toggle for 2 or 4 ohm speaker impedance loads and a longer and thicker gauge 3-prong power cable. Additionally, some components, such as the transformers, on MTI-era SVTs are of Japanese origin as opposed to the original SVT transformers made by Chicago-based ETC. In 1986, St. Louis Music acquired the rights to the Ampeg name and took possession of all remaining MTI inventory, which contained enough original components to build 500 amps. These 1987 Limited Edition SVTs were built in the U.S. by SLM's own Skunk Works crew, and each included an engraved panel indicating the unit's number within the production of 500 total units. In 1990, Ampeg introduced the SVT-II and SVT-II Pro, and in 1994, introduced the SVT-CL (Classic). In 2005, LOUD Technologies (now LOUD Audio, LLC) acquired St. Louis Music, including Ampeg. Under LOUD's management, production of Ampeg and versions of SVTs and cabinets was moved to Asia.

However, \u00c1ngel's maximum development as a musician would not come until he established the leadership of a separate collective, \u00c1ngel Parra Tr\u00edo , along with his closest associate, Los Tres' bassist Roberto \"Titae\" Lindl . With this project Parra edits a series of albums in which he not only develops his skills as a composer and virtuoso guitar player, but also establishes a framework for the interpretation of various styles, from the purest jazz to Latin American fusion. Thus he has managed to establish himself as one of the best known guitarists in the country, a celebrity within the Chilean music scene. In 2011 he formed a jazz sextet called \u00c1ngel Parra y Los Fugitivos . Since 2013 he has worked as a guitarist and producer for the singer-songwriter Manuel Garc\u00eda .

Chua started swimming at age eleven, when he and his brother decided to join the swimming team at the Philippine Columbian Association Sports Club. In 1995, he attended a swimming camp headed by American coach Mike Cody. He aimed three main goals: to claim a gold medal at the SEA Games, to advance further into the finals at the Asian Games, and most importantly, to place in the top 16 at the Olympics. In preparation for an international level, Chua was trained by Ryuzo Ishikawa, a Japanese import who served as his longest coach and mentor during his entire career. Chua qualified for the men's 100 m breaststroke at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , by achieving a FINA B-standard entry time of 1:04.93 from the Hong Kong Long Course Championships, three weeks before the Games were scheduled to begin. Despite his eligibility from FINA, Chua had been battling with the Philippine Amateur Swimming Association (PASA) for failing to inform officials and not granting a permission to compete for the qualifying tournament. On the first day of the Games, Chua challenged seven other swimmers in heat two, including three-time Olympians Jean Luc Razakarivony of Madagascar and Yevgeny Petrashov of Kyrgyzstan.

It is one of the main industrial ores of the metal vanadium and a minor source of lead . A dense, brittle mineral, it is usually found in the form of red hexagonal crystals . It is an uncommon mineral, formed by the oxidation of lead ore deposits such as galena . First discovered in 1801 in Mexico , vanadinite deposits have since been unearthed in South America, Europe, Africa, and North America. Origins Vanadinite is an uncommon mineral, only occurring as the result of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral. It is found in arid climates and forms by oxidation of primary lead minerals. Vanadinite is especially found in association with the lead sulfide, galena . Other associated minerals include wulfenite , limonite , and barite . It was originally discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo in 1801. He called the mineral \"brown lead\" and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, he was later led to believe that this was not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefstr\u00f6m discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo. Del R\u00edo's \"brown lead\" was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, Hidalgo , Mexico, and was named vanadinite because of its high vanadium content.

Associated minerals include mimetite , pyromorphite , descloizite , mottramite , wulfenite , cerussite , anglesite , calcite , barite , and various iron oxide minerals. Deposits of vanadinite are found worldwide including Austria , Spain , Scotland , the Ural Mountains , South Africa , Namibia , Morocco , Argentina , Mexico , and four states of the United States : Arizona , Colorado , New Mexico , and South Dakota . Vanadinite deposits are found in over 400 mines across the world. Notable vanadinite mines include those at Mibladen and Touisset in Morocco; Tsumeb , Namibia; Cordoba , Argentina; and Sierra County , New Mexico, and Gila County, Arizona , in the United States. The Mibladen vanadinites are likely the most popular specimens for mineral collectors. Structure Vanadinite is a lead chlorovanadate with the chemical formula Pb 5 (VO 4 ) 3 Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine.

Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms at the corners of an irregular tetrahedron . The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76 \u00c5. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain. Crystal packing Chloride coordination sphere Lead #1 coordination sphere Lead #2 coordination sphere Vanadium coordination sphere Crystals of vanadinite conform to a hexagonal system of symmetry . This internal structure is often reflected in the hexagonal external shape of the crystals. The crystals are usually in the form of short hexagonal prisms, but can also be found as hexagonal pyramids, rounded masses or crusts. A unit cell of vanadinite, the smallest divisible unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, is in the form of a hexagonal prism. The unit cell of vanadinite is composed of two of its molecules and has the dimensions a = 10.331 \u00c5 and c = 7.343 \u00c5, where a is the length of each side of the hexagon and c is the height of the prism. The volume of each unit cell of vanadinite, given by the formula V = a 2 c sin(60\u00b0), is 678.72 \u00c5 3 .

Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus , arsenic and calcium , where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium (in the first two cases) or lead (in the second). Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite . Vanadinite is usually bright-red or orange-red in colour, although sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak can be either pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent , translucent or opaque , and its lustre can range from resinous to adamantine . Vanadinite is anisotropic , meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.

Uses Along with carnotite and roscoelite , vanadinite is one of the main industrial ores of the element vanadium , which can be extracted by roasting and smelting . Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) at about 850 \u00b0C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO 3 ). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate . This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.

The episode was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and it was directed by Sarah Frost . This episode features guest appearances from Phil LaMarr , Lori Alan , Adam West , Carrot Top , and Bob Costas as well as several recurring voice actors for the series. The episode's title and plot are derived from the 1982 film Poltergeist . The episode received mixed reviews. Plot After Joe builds a home theater system, Peter decides to build a multiplex in his backyard out of spite. While digging, Peter finds the skull of a Native American buried in the backyard. Peter names it Chief Diamond Phillips . Brian frequently urges him to return the skull to its resting place, but Peter treats it as a novelty (playing with it, urinating in it, wearing it as an athletic cup, etc.). That night the Griffins start experiencing strange paranormal activity: Stewie talks to the TV static, the chairs and refrigerator stack themselves upside down on the kitchen table, Peter rips at the flesh on his face until he uncovers Hank Hill 's face, and Chris gets scared by the McDonald's clown, Ronald McDonald and he then gets attacked by an evil tree before being saved by Herbert .

Unable to wait for Stewie to come out of the closet (he is obviously reluctant to exit from Meg's rear end), Lois enters the portal and rescues Stewie. The enraged spirits emerge and ravage the Griffin house, sucking it into their world. As the Griffins drive off, Peter dumps the Native American skull in a garbage can. Now homeless , Peter and Lois try to find a way to get their house back, and learn the Native American skull has to be put back in its resting place. After searching through the city dump, a garbage man tells them that the skull would be in the human remains bin, but it was cleaned out by Carrot Top for things to use as props . They go to Carrot Top's mansion and, after a chase through a hall of mirrors, they retrieve the skull and rebury it, thereby getting back their house and returning to normal life. At the end, Lois takes the TV and moves it outside the front door but Peter comes out, retrieves it and puts Meg outside instead.

Traditionally, soap has been made from animal or plant derived fats and has been used by humans for cleaning purposes for several thousand years. Soap is not harmful to human health but, like any natural or unnatural surfactant, it does have the potential to cause environmental harm by forming a surface film that impedes the diffusion of oxygen into the water if it is added to an aquatic environment faster than it can biodegrade. Many washing agents today, from laundry and dish detergents to body wash and shampoos, are technically not soap, but synthetic detergents. They also often contain compounds that have been found to be harmful to human and wildlife health as well as to the environment. In this context, \u201cSoap Substitutes\u201d refers to cleansing products that significantly reduce or eliminate some or all of the components that have the potential to cause human or environmental harm. Throughout the last 100 years many changes have been made to the formulas of cleansing agents for these purposes, but the process of developing effective substitute detergent formulations that are completely harmless to humans and the environment is ongoing. Synthetic surfactants Petroleum derived synthetic detergents became popular in the United States during World War 2 due to shortages of animal and plant-derived fats and because they worked better when cleaning with hard water than traditional soap. By the 1950s, synthetic detergents were more commonly used than traditional soap in the United States. Many of the first synthetic detergents were made from compounds that contained branched carbon chains, which persist in the environment for far longer than their linear counterparts. Consequently, this led to the buildup of these foamy surfactants in water treatment plants as well as the formation of large flotillas of foam in waterways.

Consequently, this led to the buildup of these foamy surfactants in water treatment plants as well as the formation of large flotillas of foam in waterways. Public pressure led the US and Europe to ban the use of alkyl benzene sulphonate (ABS) and other branched chain surfactants in 1965. This sparked great interest in the development of synthetic detergents that biodegrade into environmentally friendly byproducts. Such interest has led to the development of the linear carbon chain compounds commonly used today, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate/ sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLS/SLES). While these surfactants are still derived from petroleum, a nonrenewable resource, and have been shown to cause mild to moderate irritation of skin, they biodegrade significantly faster, and this has led to a drastic reduction in surfactant pollution of waterways. While the environmental friendliness of the biodegradation byproducts of the surfactants most commonly used today varies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors and regulates claims made by companies about the environmental friendliness and potential toxicity of the biodegradation byproducts of their cleansing products. There have been continued efforts to develop surfactants that are milder to humans and pose less risk to the environment. An emerging substitute for synthetic petroleum derived surfactants such as SDS are Alkyl polyglycosides (APGs). They are derived from plant based substances such as palm oil or wheat and exposure of APGs to skin and eyes is considerably safer than their petroleum derived counterparts. Studies have shown APG use, even in large quantities, pose no measurable environmental risk, while others report that more research is needed to confirm the true environmental impact of APGs.

Phosphates in detergent products Another environmental issue with synthetic detergents is the addition of phosphates to these cleaning products. Phosphates are added to detergent as tripolyphosphate or as sodium/potassium phosphate. Phosphates interact with other ions in solution, like Calcium and Magnesium, to improve the washing ability of the detergent, especially when washing with hard water. Phosphates have also been shown to aid in killing germs when used in washing. However , most wastewater treatment processes generally remove only a small fraction of the phosphate in the water, and subsequently large quantities are released into waterways. When large quantities of phosphates accumulate in waterways, it causes a bloom in algae and a subsequent lack of oxygen in the water, which severely damages the aquatic ecosystem. This process is called \u201c eutrophication \u201d. In 1959 detergents contained 7-12% phosphate by weight, by 1969 this increased to 15-17% by weight. It is believed that during its peak use in the 1970s, half of all phosphates released by human activity was from detergents. Newfound knowledge of eutrophication from scientific research in the 1940s and 1950s along with the occurrence of massive algal blooms during the 1960s-1970s in waterways like Lake Erie led to significant public concern about the increasing pollution in lakes and rivers.

People believed phosphates from detergents to be a major cause. This led to a demand for methods of removal of phosphate from wastewater during the treatment. The first processes designed to remove phosphates from municipal wastewater (for environmental purposes) were implemented in the 1960s. During this time, two main processes were used; phosphates were removed from the wastewater by either chemical precipitation or through biological mechanisms. Further investment and research into phosphate removal methods led to the development of the modern multiphase biological reactor for removal of phosphorus-containing compounds. Despite the technological advances made in phosphate removal processes, most were designed for use in large water treatment facilities that have advanced monitoring capabilities and expert operating technicians on site. As of 1999, only 7% of municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the United States have the tertiary treatment processes needed to remove greater than 20% of the phosphate from affluent wastewater. Even today, there remains a lack of technologies for phosphate removal in the smaller water treatment facilities found in non-urban areas. By the early 1970s there was also significant public pressure on the United States government to ban phosphates in detergent cleansing products and congressional hearings on the topic were held. Detergent manufacturers explored the use of other compounds as a potential substitute for phosphates such as nitrile-tri-acetic acid (NTA), gluconic acid, citric acid , and polyelectrolytes. Ultimately, effective detergent formulations using citric acid and polyelectrolytes were developed and in some cases even sold; but they were not a comparable substitute to phosphate containing detergent formulations, either economically or in cleaning ability.

While these hearings did not result in any direct regulation of the phosphate content of detergent by the federal government, they were part of the many hearings that led to the Clean Water Act of 1972. Major soap manufactures resisted an outright ban on phosphates, and in 1970 voluntarily agreed to lower phosphate concentrations in detergents to 8.7%. Although the US federal government has made no legislation banning phosphates in laundry detergent, between 1971 and 1990, most US states independently banned or strictly limited it. In 1994, the Soap and Detergent Association (today known as the American Cleaning Institute (ACI)), a coalition representing most major detergent manufactures, voluntarily agreed to ban phosphates in consumer laundry detergents. Notably, this ban did not include dish detergents. Procter and Gamble, a detergent industry giant and ACI member, did not remove phosphates from all of their brands of laundry detergent (Tide, Ariel, Ace, and Bounty) until 2016. By 2010, many US states and municipalities also enacted regulations on the use of phosphates in dishwashing detergent. At that time, The American Cleaning Institute announced a voluntary ban on the use of phosphates in all dish detergents. Despite this, Procter & Gamble\u2019s sustainability reports only report the complete removal of phosphates from its Fairy and Dreft brand dish detergent; and these changes were not enacted until 2017. The European Union took a different path than the United States. They banned the use of phosphates in consumer laundry and dish detergents in 2014 and 2017 respectively.

Like the regulations enacted by many US states, these laws did not apply to the use of phosphates in commercial products. Although there are a number of exceptions to the laws and bans that allow phosphate use in detergent products and it is not entirely clear of the degree in which detergent manufacturers complied with their voluntary bans, there has been a significant reduction in phosphate use in detergent products. Today, formulations with zeolites, polycarboxylates, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate are among the most effective and popular substitutes for phosphates in detergent cleaning products. This, along with improved water treatment processes, has greatly contributed to a significant reduction in the amount of phosphate from detergent in waterways. These efforts have resulted in an overall reduction of the phosphate concentration in US waterways and some of the ecosystems most effected by eutrophication, such as Lake Erie, to show drastic improvement. There are also opponents to eliminating phosphates in detergent. There are widespread claims that no effective substitute for phosphate has been developed, as many people report that when washing with phosphate free dish detergents, the dishes are left with a white film or spots on them. Opponents to bans of phosphate in dish detergents argue that efforts should be focused on developing an effective method of removal during the treatment process, not banning the product itself; which is both useful and unrivaled by any substitute. Additionally, there are arguments that phosphate is not the primary cause of eutrophication in coastal waters, and therefore phosphorus should not be regulated in these regions. This argument is based upon reports that the nitrogen content of coastal waters is limited (nitrogen is required for algal growth), therefore, reduction in phosphate use would have little effect on the amount of algae that can grow in these coastal areas.

Enzyme additives There have been more recent efforts to increase the environmental sustainability of laundry and dish detergents via the addition of enzymes that break down dirt and grease. Adding enzymes significantly reduces the amount of detergent needed to wash, and subsequently reduces the amount of surfactant being put into waterways. Enzymes that have been designed to work at lower temperatures can also significantly reduce the amount of energy needed to wash clothes. For example, when using a top-load washer, switching from using \u201chot/warm\u201d or \u201cwarm/warm\u201d cycle to a \u201ccold/cold\u201d cycle uses 15 times and 11.6 times less energy, respectively. This technology has already been implemented by companies like Tide, in its Cold Water Clean Laundry Detergent. Hazardous additives Automatic dishwashing detergent is poisonous if swallowed. Formaldehyde, while not intentionally added, has also been found in some detergent cleansing products. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exposure to formaldehyde at low levels from inhalation increases one\u2019s risk of cancer and the EPA classifies formaldehyde as a B1 probable carcinogen . There has also been recent concern about potential environmental and health risks associated with an antimicrobial agent called Triclosan . Triclosan is found in so many consumer products that it is believed that 75% of all Americans have been exposed to it. While research on the health and environmental risks of Triclosan are far from complete, studies have shown it is dermally absorbed and retained in the body and it has also been shown to disrupt biological processes. Investigations of the chemical properties of Triclosan have revealed it has the potential to accumulate and persist in the environment.

Artificial fragrances can cause sensitivity, allergies, and rashes and some of these chemicals are known carcinogens and endocrine disruptors .

It was invented by the Iranian/American chemist Ali Eftekhari (President of the American Nano Society) in 2004. History The prototype device used a potassium anode and a Prussian blue compound as the cathode material for its high electrochemical stability. The prototype was successfully used for more than 500 cycles. A recent review showed currently that several pragmatic materials have been successfully used as the anode and cathode for the new generations of potassium-ion batteries. For example, the conventional anode material graphite has been shown that it can be used as an anode in a potassium-ion battery. In 2024, Group1 , created Kristonite for the cathode. Materials After the invention of potassium-ion battery with the prototype device, researchers have increasingly been focusing on enhancing the specific capacity and cycling performance with the application of new materials to electrodes (anode and cathode) and electrolyte . A general picture of the material used for potassium-ion battery can be found as follows: Cathodes Besides the original Prussian blue cathode and its analogs, researches on cathode part of potassium ion battery focus on engineering. Kristonite is a 4V cathode material \u2014 in the class of potassium prussian white (KPW) materials. Another nanostructure and solid ionics appeared. A series of potassium transition metal oxide such as K 0.3 MnO 2 , K 0.55 CoO 2 have been demonstrated as cathode material with a layered structure. Polyanionic compounds with inductive defects could provide the highest working voltage among other types of cathode for potassium-ion batteries.

During the electrochemical cycling process, its crystal structure will be distorted to created more induced defects upon the insertion of potassium ion. Recham et al first demonstrated that fluorosulfates have a reversible intercalation mechanism with K, Na and Li, since then, other polyanionic compound such as K 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , KVPO 4 F have been studied, while still limited to the complex synthesis process. Worth noting is an orthodox approach of using organic compound as cathode for potassium-ion battery, such as PTCDA, a red pigment which can bond with 11 potassium ion within single molecule. Classic alloying anodes such as Si, Sb and Sn that can form alloy with lithium ion during cycling process are also applicable for potassium-ion battery. Among them Sb is the most promising candidate due to its low cost and the theoretical capacity up to 660 mAh g \u22121 . Other organic compounds are also being developed to achieve strong mechanical strength as well as maintaining decent performance. Anodes Same as the case of lithium-ion battery, graphite could also accommodate the intercalation of potassium within electrochemical process. Whereas with different kinetics, graphite anodes suffer from low capacity retention during cycling within potassium-ion batteries. Thus, the approach of structure engineering of graphite anode is needed to achieve stable performance. Other types of carbonaceous materials besides graphite have been employed as anode material for potassium-ion battery, such as expanded graphite, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers and also nitrogen or phosphorus-doped carbon materials. Conversion anodes which can form compound with potassium ion with boosted storage capacity and reversibility have also been studied to fit for potassium-ion battery.

Electrolytes Due to the chemical activity higher than lithium, electrolytes for potassium ion battery requires more delicate engineering to address safety concerns. Commercial ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) or other traditional ether/ester liquid electrolyte showed poor cycling performance and fast capacity degradation due to the Lewis acidity of potassium, also the highly flammable feature of it has prevented further application. Ionic liquid electrolyte offers new way to expand electrochemical window of potassium ion battery with much negative redox voltage and it's especially stable with graphite anode. Recently, solid polymer electrolyte for all-solid-state potassium-ion battery have attracted much attention due to its flexibility and enhanced safety, Feng et al proposed a poly (propylene carbonate)-KFSI solid polymer electrolyte with the frame work of cellulose non-woven membrane, with boosted ionic conductivity of 1.36 \u00d7 {\\displaystyle \\times } 10 \u22125 S cm \u22121 . Research on electrolyte for potassium-ion battery is focusing on achieving fast ion diffusion kinetics, stable SEI formation as well as enhanced safety. Advantages Along with the sodium ion , potassium-ion is the prime chemistry replacement candidate for lithium-ion batteries. The potassium-ion has certain advantages over similar lithium-ion (e.g., lithium-ion batteries): the cell design is simple and both the material and the fabrication procedures are cheaper. The key advantage is the abundance and low cost of potassium in comparison with lithium, which makes potassium batteries a promising candidate for large scale batteries such as household energy storage and electric vehicles.

Another advantage of a potassium-ion battery over a lithium-ion battery is potentially faster charging. The prototype employed a KBF 4 electrolyte, though almost all common electrolyte salts can be used. In addition, ionic liquids have also recently been reported as stable electrolytes with a wide electrochemical window. The chemical diffusion coefficient of K + in the cell is higher than that of Li + in lithium batteries, due to a smaller Stokes radius of solvated K + . Since the electrochemical potential of K + is identical to that of Li + , the cell potential is similar to that of lithium-ion. Potassium batteries can accept a wide range of cathode materials which can offer rechargeability lower cost. One noticeable advantage is the availability of potassium graphite , which is used as an anode material in some lithium-ion batteries. Its stable structure guarantees a reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of potassium ions under charge/discharge. Applications In 2005, a potassium battery that uses molten electrolyte of KPF 6 was patented. In 2007, Chinese company Starsway Electronics marketed the first potassium battery-powered portable media player as a high-energy device. Potassium batteries have been proposed for large-scale energy storage given its exceptional cyclability, but current prototypes only withstand a hundred charging cycles. As of 2019, five main issues are preventing widespread use of the K-ion battery technology: low diffusion of potassium ions through a solid electrode, as well as breakdown of the potassium after repeated cycles due to changes in volume, side reactions, growth of dendrites and poor heat dissipation .

He was also an accomplished poet. Biography Latham obtained a PhD on thunderstorm electrification from Imperial College London , where he was supervised by John Mason . In 1961, he moved to Umist , now part of Manchester University , to take up a lectureship and founded the Atmospheric Physics research group. In 1988, he was hired as a senior research associate in ESSL/MMM at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado . Scientific achievements Latham is best known for his work on thunderstorm electrification and marine cloud brightening , a form of geoengineering which relies on seawater sprayed from ships. In collaboration with Stephen Salter he developed a scheme involving Flettner vessels . One of his major contributions to cloud formation theory came in 1979, with an emphasis on droplet growth and microphysics as modelled in warm clouds, namely those clouds that comprise water vapour and the microscopic droplets that begin to condense from it, rather than ice. A key problem in cloud physics was how to explain the rapid formation of droplets (something none of the models at that time were able to explain). Latham's hypothesis of \u201cinhomogeneous mixing\u201d involved discrete segments of dry air being transported into the clouds: these drier segments caused the complete evaporation of adjacent droplets, while droplets further away remained immune from the process; the fact that the cloud thereby contains fewer droplets explains why competition for the available water vapour in the cloud is reduced, allowing the largest drops to increase in size much faster than expected.

He published six full collections of poetry in all and broadcast a number of radio plays on BBC Radio 4. Latham's poetry is characterised by the kind of close observation typical of a scientist, combined with a natural ability to generate \"a strikingly original angle of vision\u201d whose metaphors \"hang around in the mind long after you\u2019ve read them\u201d. His poems received positive reviews from poets Ian McMillan , Peter Porter and John Greening , and he was published and/or reviewed in many literary outlets (including the Observer and Poetry Review ). His later work focussed more intently on the themes of ageing and memory, a significant feature of his writing as dementia took hold, complicating the latter years of his life.

He offers Michael plane tickets to and from Sydney, inviting him to come and take Walt. Michael is livid that Brian would willingly abandon Walt, but is confused when Brian says the boy is different, and \"things happen when he is around\". Michael then goes to Brian's house in Sydney, where he picks up Walt and his dog, Vincent. On the Island On Day 26, October 17, 2004, an annoyed Michael Dawson confronts Walt Lloyd, whom John Locke ( Terry O'Quinn ) has been teaching how to throw a knife , and enlists his help in scavenging parts from the wreck to build a raft. The next day, Walt tells his dad that he is going to get some water and runs off with his dog, Vincent ( Madison ). Michael initially accuses Locke of contributing to his son's delinquency despite his repeated warnings, but when he sees that the boy is not with Locke, the two men track Walt into the jungle. Michael risks his own life to save Walt from one of the island's unlikely predators, a polar bear , thus aiding the reconciliation between the two.

Wood engraving by Charles Keene , 1880. Humour and jokes about one's mother-in-law (the mother of one's spouse) are a mainstay of comedy. The humour is based on the premise that the average mother-in-law considers her son-in-law to be unsuitable for her daughter (or daughter-in-law unsuitable for her son) and may be rude, overbearing, obnoxious, and unattractive. British comedians such as Les Dawson and Jim Davidson have often used them, and many television sitcoms have featured stereotypical mothers-in-law. There is evidence that this joke dates back to Roman times: Satire VI by Juvenal says that one cannot be happy while one's mother-in-law is still alive. Most of the mother-in-law jokes are easily translatable to other languages and are easily understandable in most European cultures. In a book on cartooning written by Dave Breger , the author lists a series of \"tired gags\", and gives a suggestion on how to exploit them. In his illustration, Breger and his wife go to a museum and see a Tyrannosaurus skeleton . Mrs. Breger says, \"And no funny remarks, please, about that Mother called or something...\" A study of mothers-in-law by Pamela Cotterill found that \"they tended not to be upset by jokes because they seemed so far fetched they couldn't apply to them, but they didn't find them funny\". Cotterill also found that daughters-in-law did not find them funny either, largely because they saw that one day the jokes could be applied to them. The jokes are considered offensive by some.

Former telescopes The 0.6 m (24 in) Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) Schmidt camera was used to search for asteroids and other near-earth objects . It was built by J. W. Fecker, Inc. in 1939, given to Perkins Observatory in the 1950s, and purchased by Lowell in 1990. Starting in 1992 it was refurbished, and saw first light in the dome that previously held the Lowell Astrograph in 1997. Use of the telescope ended along with the LONEOS project in 2008. The 0.33 m (13 in) Abbot L. Lowell Astrograph, also known as the Pluto Discovery Telescope and informally as the Pluto Camera, is an astrograph built by Alvan Clark & Sons in 1929. In 1930 it was used by Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto . In 1971, it was moved a new building at Anderson Mesa, and returned to Mars Hill in 1992.

Munsterman sought the Republican nomination for governor of South Dakota in the South Dakota gubernatorial election in 2010 . In a Republican primary election on June 8, 2010, Munsterman came in second to Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard . Munsterman received 17.6% or 14,733 of the 83,832 ballots cast, approximately one third of the 50% received by Daugaard. Before gubernatorial campaign Munsterman had been part of the Brookings City Council since 2001, and he had served as mayor for six years until 2009. Prior to running for city council, Munsterman was a chiropractor. He is married to Mary Jeanne Munsterman, and they have five daughters and two grandchildren. According to the American Chiropractic Association , no chiropractor has ever been elected governor of South Dakota. Gubernatorial campaign Munsterman made education one of his biggest talking points on the gubernatorial campaign trail in 2009 and said he would reform public education in South Dakota by consolidating school districts and eliminating redundancies by suggesting there might not be a need for one superintendent per district. Munsterman is strongly pro-life, and claims that he is \"not sure what the litmus test is for conservatives these days\". During Munsterman's gubernatorial campaign, he met at least once with local ethanol producers, and assured them that, if elected, he would share their priorities. Views on health care Munsterman is opposed to government sponsored health care, and has described pending federal medical insurance plans as a \"double-barrelled shotgun point right at us\". Munsterman has also described federal medical insurance legislation as a \"runaway health care train\".

In January 2011, Munsterman cosponsored South Dakota Senate Bill 165, which aims to \"reduce by ten percent the small school adjustment in the state aid to education formula, and to appropriate the money saved by the state as a result of the reduction to fund the education service agencies.\" Also in January 2011, Munsterman cosponsored South Dakota Senate Bill 79, which would \"provide for the application of LEAN techniques to certain state government processes and to provide for prioritization and oversight of the lean government program.\" One of the stated goals of this law would be to \"align work processes, identify problematic issues, and streamline the process.\" Munsterman was also a cosponsor of HB 1193, which makes it illegal for townships in South Dakota to restrict the \"possession, transportation, sale, transfer, ownership, manufacture, or repair of firearms or ammunition or their components\" and continues on to state that \"any ordinances existing restrictions prohibited by this section are null and void.\" Coincidentally, in 2011 the South Dakota State Legislature overturned governor Daugaard's veto of House Bill 1146, which prevents health insurers from charging higher copayments for patients' visits to chiropractors than they do for patients' visits to medical doctors.

It was subdivided into 16 kharub ( caroub ), each of 13 fals ( burbe ). The fals was further subdivided into 6 qafsi ( burben ). The nasri ( asper ) was worth 2 fals . The denomination was often either not given on coins or only indicated by a numeral. Some rial denominated coins have a numeral over the Arabic letter r, \u0631. History The rial was issued by the Beys of Tunis . Although known as the piastre by Europeans, it was not equal to the Turkish kuru\u015f , also known as the piastre. From 1855, the rial was on a bimetallic standard of 1 rial = 0.17716 grams pure gold or 2.7873 grams pure silver. In 1887, the gold content of the 25 rial coin was slightly reduced to make it equivalent to 15 French francs . In 1891, this conversion rate (more conveniently expressed as 1 rial = 60 centimes) was used when the Tunisian franc replaced the rial. Coins In the early 19th century, copper 1 fals coins were issued, together with billon 1 nasri, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kharub, 1 and 2 rial, and gold sultani . A new coinage was introduced in 1847, consisting of copper 1 fals, 1 nasri, 1 \u2044 2 and 1 kharub and silver 2 and 5 rial denominations.

The gold coins were initially struck in pure gold, later reduced to .900 fineness, with the 20, 40 and 80 rial denominations short-lived. The 6 and 13 nasri coins were later overstamped with the Arabic numerals \"1\" and \"2\" (\"\u0661\" and \"\u0662\") to indicate that they were to circulate as 1 and 2 kharub coins, an increase in value of \u00bd nasri for the 6 nasri coin. In 1864, a new copper coinage was introduced in denominations of 1 \u2044 4 , 1 \u2044 2 , 1, 2, 4, 8 kharub. Silver 8 kharub and gold 5 rial were also introduced.

Located in the city's downtown, Colon Street is often called the oldest and shortest national road in the Philippines . It is named after Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n ( Christopher Columbus ). Built in 1565, the street traces its origins to Miguel Lopez de Legazpi , the Spanish conquistador who arrived in the Philippines to establish a colony in the 16th century and eventually developed the street under his leadership. Colon Street, c. 1938 Colon, crowded and a bit run-down now, was the site of fashionable shops, offices, and movie houses. It was once the heart of Cebu City's shopping and business activity. Beginning in the early 1990s, much of this activity has shifted to the more modern, bigger, and diverse commercial and business districts now spread in almost all of the urban areas of Cebu in what was considered residential and leisure settlements. Colon Street historical marker in Filipino (left) and Cebuano (right) In 2006, the Cebu City Council proposed a plan to close parts of Colon Street from vehicular traffic and convert it into a tourism zone. However, this proposal received opposition from businessmen and motorists due to concerns about security and parking spaces. In 2007, the Colon Night Market, which aims to revive Colon as a vibrant commercial hub, was launched. The night market runs multiple times throughout the year, most notably during the Filipino Christmas season from September to December until the Sinulog celebrations in January of the following year.

Since its launch, the night market has run yearly with the exemption of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Historical dispute While Colon Street has long been recognized as the oldest street in the Philippines, this claim is being challenged. Historians point out that no document or map confirms the construction of Colon Street during the initial period of the Spanish era in the Philippines. The earliest map indicating the presence of Colon Street was dated 1873. The origin of Colon Street being labeled as the oldest street in the Philippines can be traced back to 1910. During that time, Cebu-based shop American Bazar sold a postcard showing a section of Colon Street with a label \"Oldest Street in Cebu\". A few years later, photo studio L.G. Joseph printed a postcard of the same street, this time with the label \u201cOldest Street in the Philippines\u201d. The claim gained further traction in 1933, when the American Express Company added this information to their first ever guidebook of the Philippines.

The line on which the station sits is single-track, laid to standard gauge, but there is a loop at the station, allowing trains to pass there, with a second, parallel, loop lying out-of-use as of October 2016. A daily international train runs between Pristina and Skopje , in North Macedonia . Events During the era when Kosovo was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the country's leader Marshall Tito occasionally visited Pristina, arriving on his personal Blue Train . During the 1999 Kosovo War , Serbian and Yugoslav regular forces, in conjunction with paramilitaries, conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanian inhabitants of Pristina through the station. Many of those expelled were directed onto trains apparently brought there for the express purpose of deporting them to the Macedonian border, where they were forced into exile.

It was formed by Matt Vinci, Anthony Truglio and Frank Cortese. History Liege Lord was originally a Judas Priest cover band named Deceiver (after the Judas Priest song of the same name). Judas Priest's influence can be heard in the early vocals and guitar riffs of the Freedom's Rise album. Liege Lord first signed on with the French record label Black Dragon after Christian Logue of Savage Grace recommended the company to the band. Freedom's Rise was released in 1985 on Black Dragon in Europe, and on Ironworks in America. Reaching cult status in the metal world with their three releases, the band featured Joe Comeau, who would later go on to play with thrash metal bands Overkill and Annihilator . Guitarist Anthony Truglio went on to play in the band Gandhi with Page Hamilton from Helmet , and also played in the new version of Helmet. Guitarist Paul Nelson would go on to play with Blues/Rock icon Johnny Winter and winning a Grammy Award and multiple Grammy Nominations signing with his own solo artist deal on Sony/EMI Records. Master Control was recorded from March 22 to April 11, 1988. The album was produced by Terry Date and Liege Lord. As of August 2012, Liege Lord has been active again and headlined the Keep It True XVI festival, which took place from April 19 to 20, 2013, at Tauberfrankenhalle in Lauda-K\u00f6nigshofen , Germany.

Released in 1972, this is his second solo album although it was credited to Jeremy Spencer and the Children, referring to his band made up of members of the Children of God (Family International) organisation. After leaving Fleetwood Mac while on tour in the United States in February 1971, Spencer joined the Children of God and has remained with the organisation ever since. The band toured in the US and released a single \"Can You Hear the Song\" / \"The World in Her Heart\" to accompany this album. The lyrics were heavily religious, with references to the love of God, finding purpose in life within Christianity , along with anti-war themes and apocalypticism . Although this was the first recording for which Spencer dropped his mimicry and parody of 1950s music and Elmore James blues tunes, he nevertheless continued to show his talent for drawing inspiration from other styles of music. Influences from many contemporary sources can be heard, such as The Byrds , The Beatles , Jefferson Airplane and Creedence Clearwater Revival .

The airline was started in 1981 as the latest in a series of aviation businesses controlled by George E. Batchelor, starting in 1946 with an earlier California-based airline Arrow Airways , an irregular air carrier shut down by the Federal government in 1951. Batchelor saw Arrow Air as a re-start of Arrow Airways, though they were separate corporations and separate certificates . At different times over the years, Arrow Air operated over 90 weekly scheduled cargo flights, had a strong charter business and at one point operated scheduled international and domestic passenger flights. Its main base was Miami International Airport. Arrow Air ceased operations on June 29, 2010, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 1, 2010. It was then liquidated. History California origins George E. Batchelor was a pilot for the Air Transport Command during World War II. . He founded Arrow Airways in Redondo Beach , California on the last day of 1946. Arrow Airways was an irregular air carrier , a hybrid charter/scheduled airline regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), a now-defunct Federal agency which tightly controlled almost all US commercial air transportation at the time. Arrow Airways was prominent among those irregular air carriers that (illegally, see below) offered transcontinental scheduled air service. It called its aircraft Arrowliners. In the 12 months ending June 1950, it had the sixth largest revenue passenger miles out of 49 irregular airlines.

In addition, it's also known (see next paragraph) to have had two Douglas DC-3s during those twelve months. In 1949, Batchelor established a second airline, California Arrow Airlines (CAA), as an intrastate airline and started flying Los Angeles - Oakland - Sacramento 23 May. In addition, CAA served Fresno for about a month starting in August. CAA had two DC-3s leased from Arrow Airways. CAA was one of eight intrastate airlines that started service that year in California, all failing quickly other than California Central Airlines and Pacific Southwest Airlines . In an article dated December 7, Batchelor was quoted saying that CAA was just about breaking even, that \"it is hardly worthwhile operating.\" December 7 was to be CAA's last day of operation. On December 7, CAA suffered a devastating DC-3 crash in which Batchelor's own wife and two-year old son died. Meanwhile, the CAB had launched an investigation into Arrow Airways. On 16 January 1951, the CAB revoked Arrow's \"Letter of Registration\" (i.e. certificate) as of February 15, 1951 for illegal operation of scheduled service between New York and Los Angeles and New York and Oakland. Arrow Airways was initially based at Torrance Municipal Airport (also known as Lomita Flight Strip), but at the end it, and California Arrow Airlines, were based at Burbank .

(Batch Air eventually became owned by an employee group and was sold to Greenwich Air in 1987 for more than $30 million.) Arrow added scheduled passenger services in April 1982, beginning with California-Montego Bay. Low fares were causing the company to lose money. In October 1984, it canceled several routes, including Tampa \u2013London. At the same time, the company reoriented its route structure from an east\u2013west alignment to a north\u2013south one, reported Aviation Week & Space Technology.

In 1985, more than one million people flew onboard Arrow Air to 245 destinations in 72 countries with the majority of these flights being unscheduled charter service. Arrow Air was operating Douglas DC-8 and wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft at this time. Like other start-ups, Arrow contracted some functions to other airlines. United Airlines trained Arrow Air crews in Denver , and Florida Air supplemented Batch-Air's maintenance work. The company was approved for military charters in 1984, and in October 1985 won a $13.8 million contract with the Department of Defense . This accounted for only a small segment of Arrow's revenues.

On December 12, 1985, one of the company's DC-8s crashed after takeoff in Gander, Newfoundland , killing 248 soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division and eight of Arrow's flight crew personnel. The flight had originated in Cairo and had taken on fuel in Gander after stopping in Cologne, West Germany. The accident resulted in a great deal of unfavorable media coverage and government scrutiny for the airline. Arrow filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on February 11, 1986, laying off 400 employees. However, operations continued. Richard Haberly was named president of Arrow Air in 1987.

In 1987, Arrow began leasing a DC-8 to LOT Polish Airlines for a Warsaw \u2013New York\u2013Chicago route. It also provided a long-range Douglas DC-8-62 CF jet to Air Marshall Islands which was operated in a mixed passenger/freight combi aircraft configuration on flights linking several remote Pacific islands with Honolulu.

In the mid-1990s, Arrow's fleet numbered 18 aircraft including Douglas DC-8s and Boeing 727-200s (two of which were configured for passengers). Many of the planes were acquired from bankrupt Eastern Air Lines . The company removed the Boeing 727s from the fleet and began leasing Lockheed L-1011 wide-body jets in 1996 when its fleet numbered just nine aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded Arrow in March 1995, charging the carrier had improperly documented maintenance. A company spokesman countered that the grounding was unfair and was related simply to the FAA's request that Arrow prints out a hard copy of its fleet records, which were stored electronically. Company officials blamed the affair on a disgruntled employee who had been fired for theft. Arrow contracted other carriers to handle its business during the crisis. British Airways , for example, handled the route between Columbus, Ohio , and Glasgow , Scotland. Arrow also laid off 368 of its 587 employees. During the shutdown, Arrow lost $3.5 million, plus another $1.5 million in FAA fines. The FAA allowed the company to begin flying cargo again in June 1995.

Cabeza had been vice-president of operations at Arrow. Arrow failed to profit from the upswing in the economy in 1997. It lost $15.1 million for the year on revenues of $88.3 million. The company had posted losses of $11.3 million in 1996 on revenues of $61.1 million. Arrow started a new weekly service from Houston to Peru and Ecuador in February 1998.

Included in the purchase were 13 Douglas DC-8 jets, four Lockheed L-1011 wide-body jets, 130 jet engines, and spare parts. The buy gave Arrow access to Fine's 133,000-square-foot (12,400 m 2 ) refrigerated distribution facility for handling perishables, which made up the bulk of Latin American cargo. Unfortunately, Fine Air had its own set of woes resulting from a fatal crash of one of its DC-8s in August 1997 . This scuttled Fine's planned $123 million initial public offerings. Rising fuel costs, a downturn in the Latin American market, and debt left over from its Arrow Air acquisition combined to make the airline unflyable. Fine lost $108 million in 2000 on revenues of $152 million, and another $36 million on 2001 revenues of $148 million. The company filed for bankruptcy on September 27, 2000, and subsequently merged with Arrow Air, Inc., leaving behind the Fine Air Services name. The Fine family would no longer control the company. It emerged from Chapter 11 in May 2002 as a unit of Arrow Air Holdings Corp., a Greenwich, Connecticut , investment group led by Dort Cameron. Revenues were $148 million in 2001 when Arrow had about 800 employees in Miami and another 200 in other locations. The fleet had grown to 16 DC-8s and two Lockheed L-1011s ; the carrier had also begun leasing a pair of McDonnell Douglas DC-10s . The new Arrow was losing $3 million a month, reported Traffic World in early 2002, yet the company aimed to break even by year-end.

Arrow re-entered the charter business and diversified geographically via partnerships with airlines such as Atlas Air , Lloyd A\u00e9reo Boliviano , and Air Global International (AGI). AGI had been formed in 2001 and leased two Boeing 747s to carry cargo to South America. Its routes complemented those of Arrow Air, which acquired AGI in March 2002. Operationally, Arrow Air planned to retire its Lockheed L-1011 by 2003 and replace its dozen DC-8s with DC-10s a few years after. In January 2004 Arrow Air filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but exited in June 2004 after a bankruptcy court approved its restructuring.

As of April, indications were MatlinPatterson would be shuttering Arrow Cargo. End of operations Arrow Cargo ceased scheduled operations on June 30, 2010.

On April 4, 2001, at 01:00 AM Arrow Air Flight from Cali after a refueling stop had a nose landing gear malfunction warning. After checklists completed with putting gear handle down, the nose gear down lock indices were inspected through a viewing hole after depressurizing the jet in flight, and the crew found stowaways in the nose gear compartment and the nose gear down lock 1/8\" out of alignment in agreement with the warning. They hoped to land with gear held in place by the 3000 psi hyd pressure. They touched down at 120 kias but at about 90 acidic Skydrol fumes came into the flight deck through the open down lock viewing hole. The fumes turned out to be caused by a broken line in the ceiling of the gear well going to the hyd pressure sensor because of it being tightly held on to by one of the stowaways fearful of the gear doors opening again, evidenced by the stainless line being found broken downwards instead of upwards by the crushing event when the loss of hydraulic pressure through the broken line allowed the nose gear to collapse.

Though they are exempt from many requirements, charter schools are required to administer state standardized tests. History North Carolina Charter schools were established by North Carolina House Bill 955 in 1996, also known as the Charter School Act. Charter schools were established in an effort to improve the academic chances and performance of those that were at-risk and those that were academically gifted, but all students eligible for public school are eligible to apply to a charter school. The Act allowed an organization or person could apply to start a charter school. Approved schools are state-funded but managed by a community board instead of a school board. As of February 2011 there is a state cap of 100 charter schools total, but the new Republican majority in the North Carolina General Assembly has started a movement to lift the cap. In January, 2011, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools ranked North Carolina's charter school law 32 out of 41 states with charter school laws, with poor marks for accountability, equity of funding, and the low cap of 100 schools in the state. In Peltier v. Charter Day School (2022), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a North Carolina charter school was a state actor for purposes of constitutional claims and that its skirts-only requirement for female students violated the Equal Protection Clause and was subject to Title IX . Differences between County Schools and Public Charter Schools Charter schools are: not required to provide transportation for students, although many do have transportation options not required to provide breakfast or lunch for students, although many do provide for students who qualify for free & reduced price lunches allowed to serve students from other counties. allowed to craft a schedule and calendar that fits the needs of the families and students they serve, apart from the traditional 180-day school calendar. allowed to have non-certified teachers. allowed to employ teachers on short-term", "source_type": "random"}

The timing coincided with the expiry of the annual International Human Rights Day . On 11 December, at approximately 3 am, the IDF conducted raids on the offices of Addameer and two other Palestinian NGOs, and from Addameer's offices four computers from the legal and documentation units containing information on prisoners and their cases, a hard drive, a video camera and employees' business cards were confiscated. The soldiers also ripped off and tore up posters of prisoners and hunger strikers pinned on the office walls. In the view of Allam Jarrar of the Palestinian NGO Network, the raid's timing was to be seen in the context of the United Nations General Assembly 's recognition of Palestine as a de facto state two weeks earlier, on 29 November. Executive Director Sahar Francis told Human Rights Watch that video equipment and paper files of prisoner's cases were also missing after the raid. According to a military spokesperson, the raids were based on a suspicion that the three NGOs were affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), though no evidence has been produced to substantiate the claim, and the NGOs themselves deny the assertion. The Israeli Human Rights NGO B'Tselem , also in the name of several other human rights organisations such as Gisha and Yesh Din , issued a strong protest, demanding not only the restitution of the confiscated property but that protection be given to civil society organizations, in particular those engaged in upholding the cause of human rights. Human Rights Watch also demanded that compensation be made for the damage caused. Joe Stork deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch stated: In the absence of warrants or demonstrated military necessity, these raids are nothing but an unlawful attempt to seriously harm the work of groups supporting the local population..

The loss of the material caused difficulties for the group at a time when 5,150 Palestinian prisoners, many assisted by Addameer, were incarcerated by Israel, and often in Israel, in contravention again of international law. 2022 On 18 August 2022, Israeli forces raided the headquarters of Addameer and six other organisations in Ramallah and al-Bireh, removed computers and equipment and ordered their closure. Terrorist designation In October 2021, Addameer was designated a terrorist organization by Israel, together with five other Palestinian non-profit, non-governmental organizations ( Al-Haq , Bisan Center for Research and Development , Defence for Children International , Union of Palestinian Women's Committees and Union of Agricultural Work Committees ). The designation was condemned by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , and the UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights who called it a \"frontal attack on the Palestinian human rights movement and on human rights everywhere\".

On June 10, 2025, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Addameer along with four other charities, accusing them of supporting terrorist groups including affiliation with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Hamas' military wing under the pretense of humanitarian aid. The move was criticized by human rights organizations Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International . Following the sanctions, the website and social media presence of Addameer were taken down. UK Lawyers for Israel claimed responsibility for the takedown following a letter informing the domain name registrar of the U.S. sanctions.

They planned a full, co-educational college to serve people in East Texas . On June 12, 1909, the name of the college was changed from Texas College to Phillips University . It was named for Bishop Henry Phillips and his leadership. The name reversal occurred in 1910 at the Third Annual Conference of the church.

Between 1756 and 1780, she wrote political essays and news from abroad for many newspapers under various pseudonyms , most notably Probus (in The Gazetteer and the Public Ledger ). Unknown in her lifetime, in more recent years Forman's career has garnered significance as she was one of the few women of the period who wrote essays on what were considered masculine subjects (politics and trade). Essays and writings which can be attributed to her have been described as erudite and moralising and, due to sexist attitudes towards women prevalent at the time, were considered to have been written by a man. Early life Forman was one of five children of Charles Forman, an Irish Jacobite and pamphleteer, and his wife Mary. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 , her father (a clerk of the English war office) fled to France after he delayed sending orders to the English general Charles Wills , who was fighting the Jacobites. Therefore, there is ambiguity as to whether Charlotte was born in England or France, although she later wrote that she was \"nursed in the palace of the Trianon \" in France. She however lived in London for most of her life in extreme poverty, and went into debtors' prison for a short time in 1767. Writing career Forman was unknown in her lifetime but in more recent years her career garnered significance as she was one of the few women of the period who wrote essays on stereotypically masculine subjects.

Forman wrote a number of letters 'To the printer' as a regular correspondent. Forman's essays in the Gazetteer and the Public Ledger , all signed under the pseudonym Probus, were written in the months leading up to and during the Seven Years' War . A large number (roughly 200) of the surviving essays comment upon the diplomatic news, offering historical background relevant to understanding the interests of the contending nations, weighing the credibility of various news reports, and analysing the interests of England, Prussia, France, Holland, Austria, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. She consistently supported the English war effort, reassures readers that England has the capacity to defeat France, defends Frederick the Great and William Pitt the Elder from critics, and argues against a premature peace that would make unnecessary concessions to France. Her frequent correspondence with Radical satirist and politician John Wilkes have been described as providing modern readers with \"graphic evidence of the struggles of an independent woman in the 18th century attempting to support herself by writing\". She described herself as a literary day labourer . She is not known to have published anything under her own name, although there are almost certainly many works published anonymously which cannot now be attributed.

Later in the war, he commanded an independent force that operated on the east coast of Spain. Early career Murray served as Quartermaster General in India from 1801 to 1805. There, \"his alternations of torpor and feverish activity had greatly embarrassed the young Arthur Wellesley with whom he was supposed to be cooperating.\" He married Anne Elizabeth Cholmley Phipps on 25 August 1807.

This 2,900-strong unit included the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 7th King's German Legion (KGL) Infantry battalions, plus elements of the 1st and 2nd KGL Light Infantry. After giving Murray two additional cavalry squadrons, Wellington entrusted him with the task of crossing the Douro River and cutting off the escape route of Marshal Nicolas Soult 's French corps. Accordingly, Murray crossed the Douro at a ferry 5 miles (8.0 km) east of Porto and moved north. However, he failed to seriously contest the French retreat to the northeast. Instead, he skirmished ineffectually with the enemy. Michael Glover, historian of the Peninsular War, calls Murray \"a stupid and irresolute officer.\" He soon left Portugal because he feared he would have to serve under William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford , who was a marshal of the Portuguese Army.

On 31 July 1812, an 8,000-man Anglo-Sicilian force under Thomas Maitland landed at Alicante on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. It then went through a succession of commanders until February 1813, when Murray, now a lieutenant-general, took command. By this time, the force was 10,000 men strong. Of these, 3,000 were Sicilians and Italians, while the rest were British and KGL troops. Two Spanish divisions, 8,000 men, also came under his orders. With his 18,200-man army, Murray defeated Marshal Louis Suchet at the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813. Though Suchet's 13,200 were considerably outnumbered and the battle was largely won by the steadiness of the British and Spanish infantry, Castalla was undoubtedly Murray's finest hour. But he did not pursue the beaten French, continuing his withdrawal to the coast. Fiasco at Tarragona Soon after, Wellington ordered Murray to move by sea to capture the port of Tarragona . By this manoeuvre, Wellington intended to distract Suchet from his summer offensive (this ended in victory in the Battle of Vitoria ). Rear-Admiral Benjamin Hallowell Carew put Murray's 16,000 men ashore six miles south of Tarragona on 2 June.

Rather than storm these, Murray chose to reduce them by siege. By 7 June, his siege guns had reduced one of the two forts to rubble. Meanwhile, Major-General Charles Decaen sent Major-General Maurice Mathieu with 6,000 men south from Barcelona to interfere with the siege. At the same time, Suchet marched 8,000 men north from Valencia toward Tarragona. Soon, a Spanish move against Valencia caused the southern column to be recalled. Mathieu bumped into Copons's pickets, found that he was facing a combined force of 23,000 men and quickly backpedalled. By this time, Murray had been driven into a state of panic by rumours of the two French relief columns. He cancelled a planned 11 June attack on the small outwork and ordered his supplies to be taken aboard ship. Later, he decided to withdraw his entire force. Issuing a stream of orders that confused everyone and enraged Hallowell, Murray finally got his entire force aboard ship after spiking and abandoning the eighteen heavy siege cannon. Copons was advised to flee to the mountains. Once safely aboard, Murray determined to land at a different place on 15 June. Soon, confusion again reigned. In despair, Hallowell wrote, \"the debarkation and the re-embarkation continually going on was enough to confound any operation in the world.\" Mathieu finally marched into Tarragona on 16 June.

Later career After the war ended in 1814, Murray was court-martialled for his conduct before Tarragona. The court acquitted him of all charges except one: he was found guilty of abandoning his guns without due cause and admonished by the court. Acting as though he was cleared of all charges, Murray petitioned to become a member of the Order of the Bath , but was denied. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis from 1811 to 1818. Murray died on 15 October 1827. Footnotes References Glover, Michael. The Peninsular War 1807-1814.

Education and career Alfred Brauer was Richard's brother and seven years older. They were born to a Jewish family. Both were interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an inventor, and in February 1919 enrolled in Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg . He soon transferred to University of Berlin . Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg , he studied in Berlin, being awarded his PhD on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible , continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups . Ilse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Brauer were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians.

Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust . Hermann Weyl invited Brauer to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups . Through the influence of Emmy Noether , Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory , published in 1937. Robert Steinberg , Stephen Arthur Jennings , and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer\u2019s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras . In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching. In 1948, Brauer moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in modern algebra at University of Michigan . In 1952, Brauer joined the faculty of Harvard University and retired in 1971.

The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as Reinhold Baer , Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski , and Carl Ludwig Siegel . Mathematical work Several theorems bear his name, including Brauer's induction theorem , which has applications in number theory as well as finite group theory , and its corollary Brauer's characterization of characters , which is central to the theory of group characters . The Brauer\u2013Fowler theorem , published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the classification of finite simple groups , for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the centralizer of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure. Brauer introduced the idea of \"resolvent degree\" in 1975. He applied modular representation theory to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his three main theorems . These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank Sylow 2-subgroups . The Brauer\u2013Suzuki theorem showed that no finite simple group could have a generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup, and the Alperin\u2013Brauer\u2013Gorenstein theorem classified finite groups with wreathed or quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the Gorenstein\u2013Walter theorem , classifying finite groups with a dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, and Glauberman's Z* theorem .

Dade , also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The Brauer tree is a combinatorial object associated to a block with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block. Brauer formulated numerous influential problems on modular representation theory , among which the Brauer height zero conjecture and the k(B) conjecture . In 1970, he was awarded the National Medal of Science . Hypercomplex numbers Eduard Study had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for Klein's encyclopedia in 1898. This article was expanded for the French language edition by Henri Cartan in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study\u2019s article, and Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened. Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was published by Okayama University in Japan . It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his Collected Papers . His title was \"Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)\".

Consider his introduction: In the beginning of the 19th century, the usual complex numbers and their introduction through computations with number-pairs or points in the plane, became a general tool of mathematicians. Naturally the question arose whether or not a similar \"hypercomplex\" number can be defined using points of n -dimensional space. As it turns out, such extension of the system of real numbers requires the concession of some of the usual axioms (Weierstrass 1863). The selection of rules of computation, which cannot be avoided in hypercomplex numbers, naturally allows some choice. Yet in any cases set out, the resulting number systems allow a unique theory with regard to their structural properties and their classification. Further, one desires that these theories stand in close connection with other areas of mathematics, wherewith the possibility of their applications is given. While still in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in Mathematische Zeitschrift \"\u00dcber Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen\" which was primarily concerned with integral domains (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the field theory which he used later in Toronto.

Education and early career June Broomhead was born in Doncaster , England in June 1922. She joined the University of Cambridge , UK, in 1941. She completed the requirements for her degree in 1944, and joined the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. World War II forced her to leave her research career, however. She was encouraged to become a teacher and spent two years teaching science in a school. She returned to Cambridge in 1946. She completed her undergraduate courses in 1944 at Newnham College , but Cambridge did not give women undergraduate degrees prior to 1948. She was awarded her bachelor's degree 50 years after earning it. She solved the crystal structure of a complex of adenine and guanine . She delineated the shape and dimensions of the two nitrogenous subunits of DNA . She proposed that complementary nucleobases are bound together by hydrogen bonds , work that was expanded by Bill Cochran . Her research, particularly the prediction of hydrogen bonds , was researched and used by Watson and Crick to determine the structure of DNA .

The SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a \"blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all\". The SDGs, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and intended to be achieved by the year 2030, are part of a UN Resolution called \"The 2030 Agenda\". The targets and indicators for the SDGs are included in the UN Resolution adopted by the General Assembly two years later on 6 July 2017. The Commonwealth of Australia was one of the 193 countries that adopted the 2030 Agenda in September 2015. Implementation of the agenda is led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) with different federal government agencies responsible for each of the goals. In November 2020, the Transforming Australia: SDG Progress Report stated that while Australia was performing well in health (SDG 3 ) and education ( SDG 4 ) it was falling behind in the reduction of CO 2 emissions ( SDG 13 ), waste and environmental degradation ( SDG 12 , SDG 14 and SDG 15 ), and addressing economic inequality (SDG 10 ).

Background The 17 Sustainable Development Goals Role in the SDGs creation The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) led Australia's contribution to the development of the 2030 Agenda, which comprises the SDGs and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda . In its 2015-2016 Annual Report, DFAT said its actions successfully ensured that Australia's national interest and existing aid, trade and foreign policy priorities, and those of its development partners, were reflected in the outcome. DFAT was active in securing standalone SDGs for economic growth ( SDG 8 ), gender equality ( SDG 5 ) and peace and good governance ( SDG 16 ). In doing so, helps strengthen \"existing international frameworks, such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women\". National co-ordination and governance To co-ordinate Australia's domestic and international efforts to advance the 2030 Agenda, the Australian Government formed an Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) of senior officials. Co-chaired by PM&C and the DFAT , the committee collaborates with domestic stakeholders to promote and monitor Australia's progress. Responsibility for each goal is allocated to an Australian Government agency and each department is responsible for making the latest available data on the SDG data platform.

In addition to providing the status of Australia's data collection against all 232 SDG indicators, as progress is made over time on identifying data-sets or the SDG indicators are refined, other datasets can be uploaded to the platform. It will also assist with streamlining SDG reporting for other purposes as it can interact with other reporting instruments like the Sendai Framework . The \"data community\" was interested in seeing what actions the Australian Government has taken to plug existing data gaps to monitor progress on the SDGs. The launch of a new platform for SDG data, in addition to the VNR, was very welcome. The platform provides an incentive to improve its ability to report and by taking on this task in 'its own right', Australia \"is best able to support neighbouring countries to meet their own data challenges\". National SDGs Website In June 2018, the Global Compact Network Australia (GNCA) launched a website that allowed organisations to share their SDG aligned projects and activities in one location.

The Senate report included a dissenting report from Coalition Senators, concerned that many of the recommendations would create unnecessary bureaucracy, regulation and expense for no benefit. The Government's decision to mainstream the SDGs across its agencies and the create of inter-departmental committee from the very beginning, had already put in place the foundations needed to purse the goals. On this basis, the dissenting Senators \"encouraged the Government to ignore the recommendations of the majority report\". The committee's first recommendation is the publication of a national SDG implementation plan that \"includes national priorities and regular reports of Australia's performance against the goals\". More than a year after this recommendation was made, \"the government is yet to release such a plan or indicate when such a roadmap will be presented\". As of June 2020, none of these recommendations have been implemented by the Government. Reception In 2018, the Australian Council For International Development (ACFID) CEO, Marc Purcell, gave Australia a 'good effort, but must try harder' mark for self-assessing its progress against international bench-marks. The Australian Government recognised shortcomings and championed good practice and it acknowledged the goals as 'the' blue print for a 'whole of Australia' collective response to shared global challenges. \"With such goodwill and understanding\", Marc Purcell asks, \"why is Australia falling behind?\". SDSN Australia, New Zealand & Pacific said the VNR was a significant step in Australia's affirmation in its commitment to the SDGs, however to meet the 2030 targets more urgency is required to move beyond \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.

COVID-19 pandemic response A group of Australian businesses, industry groups, universities and civil society organisations has called on the Australian Government to use the SDGs as a framework for Australia's recovery from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic . In a letter to the Australian Prime Minister , 52 organisations said the SDGs outline a path to 2030 that leaves no one behind and asked the Government to consider \"building on the achievements that Australia has made against the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals\". The Transforming Australia: SDG Progress Report - Update 2020 included an evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on Australia's capacity to achieve the SDGs. It reported that trends emerging before the pandemic - higher levels of unemployment, poverty and psychological distress - have been amplified and \"could fracture Australian society\".

She was one of the people implicated in the infamous Spana Prosecution . Life Conti was the daughter of the rich merchant Emerick Conti (1611-1657). She married the failed French immigrant painter Simon Imbert (d. 1658). The marriage was described as an unhappy one: her spouse reportedly abused her and she suspected him of having poisoned her father. When she was widowed in 1658, she was rumoured to have poisoned her late spouse. On 31 January 1659, Giovanna De Grandis was arrested in Rome and imprisoned in the Papal prison at Tor di Nona , which was the beginning of the infamous Spana Prosecution , exposing Gironima Spana 's net work of poison dealers in Rome. In April, Conti was named by Maria Spinola , who stated that Conti had bought poison from Laura Crispoldi to murder her husband. Conti was not arrested. Being a member of the upper class, she was interviewed in her own residence. After having been granted immunity from the Pope, she confessed to have murdered her spouse because she believed he had murdered her father. After having signed her statement, Conti was left out of further investigation. Instead, her maid Benedetta Merlini, who had introduced Conti to Crispoldi, was arrested and imprisoned in Tor di Nona, where she was interrogated under torture and testified against Crispoldi.

Simplified diagram Deoxyribonucleic acid ( pronunciation \u24d8 ; DNA ) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix . The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses . DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids . Alongside proteins , lipids and complex carbohydrates ( polysaccharides ), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life . The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases ( cytosine , guanine , adenine or thymine ), a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage ) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone . The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, the single-ringed pyrimidines and the double-ringed purines .

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel . Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or bases ). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription , where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U). Under the genetic code , these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation . Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes . Before typical cell division , these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms ( animals , plants , fungi and protists ) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA , and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA . In contrast, prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm , in circular chromosomes . Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones , compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides . The structure of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds . Both chains are coiled around the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms (3.4 nm ). The pair of chains have a radius of 10 \u00c5 (1.0 nm). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22\u201326 \u00c5 (2.2\u20132.6 nm) wide, and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3 \u00c5 (0.33 nm) long. The buoyant density of most DNA is 1.7g/cm 3 . DNA does not usually exist as a single strand, but instead as a pair of strands that are held tightly together. These two long strands coil around each other, in the shape of a double helix . The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside , and a base linked to a sugar and to one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide . A biopolymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide . The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar groups.

The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose , which is a pentose (five- carbon ) sugar. The sugars are joined by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These are known as the 3\u2032-end (three prime end), and 5\u2032-end (five prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond . Therefore, any DNA strand normally has one end at which there is a phosphate group attached to the 5\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 5\u2032 phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl group attached to the 3\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 3\u2032 hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a nucleic acid double helix , the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel . The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5\u2032 ), and three prime end (3\u2032), with the 5\u2032 end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3\u2032 end a terminal hydroxyl group.

Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, forming A-T and G-C base pairs . Nucleobase classification The nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines , A and G , which are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds , and the pyrimidines , the six-membered rings C and T . A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil ( U ), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology. Non-canonical bases Modified bases occur in DNA. The first of these recognized was 5-methylcytosine , which was found in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The reason for the presence of these noncanonical bases in bacterial viruses ( bacteriophages ) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses. Modifications of the bases cytosine and adenine, the more common and modified DNA bases, play vital roles in the epigenetic control of gene expression in plants and animals.

These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site . As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. The major groove is 22 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms (2.2 nm) wide, while the minor groove is 12 \u00c5 (1.2 nm) in width.

This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below) , but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in width that would be seen if the DNA was twisted back into the ordinary B form . Base pairing Top, a GC base pair with three hydrogen bonds . Bottom, an AT base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are shown as dashed lines. In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary base pairing . Purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix (from six-carbon ring to six-carbon ring) is called a Watson-Crick base pair. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC -content. A Hoogsteen base pair (hydrogen bonding the 6-carbon ring to the 5-carbon ring) is a rare variation of base-pairing.

The two strands can come apart\u2014a process known as melting\u2014to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperatures, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used). The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC -content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the melting temperature (also called T m value), which is the temperature at which 50% of the double-strand molecules are converted to single-strand molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC -content have more strongly interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have more weakly interacting strands.

When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others. Amount Schematic karyogram of a human. It shows 22 homologous chromosomes , both the female (XX) and male (XY) versions of the sex chromosome (bottom right), as well as the mitochondrial genome (to scale at bottom left). The blue scale to the left of each chromosome pair (and the mitochondrial genome) shows its length in terms of millions of DNA base pairs .

For example, the human mitochondrial DNA forms closed circular molecules, each of which contains 16,569 DNA base pairs, with each such molecule normally containing a full set of the mitochondrial genes. Each human mitochondrion contains, on average, approximately 5 such mtDNA molecules. Each human cell contains approximately 100 mitochondria, giving a total number of mtDNA molecules per human cell of approximately 500. However, the amount of mitochondria per cell also varies by cell type, and an egg cell can contain 100,000 mitochondria, corresponding to up to 1,500,000 copies of the mitochondrial genome (constituting up to 90% of the DNA of the cell). Sense and antisense A DNA sequence is called a \"sense\" sequence if it is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein. The sequence on the opposite strand is called the \"antisense\" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear. One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing. A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses , blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes . In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand.

Supercoiling DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA supercoiling . With DNA in its \"relaxed\" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases . These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication . Alternative DNA structures From left to right, the structures of A , B and Z-DNA DNA exists in many possible conformations that include A-DNA , B-DNA , and Z-DNA forms, although only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms.

An alternative analysis was proposed by Wilkins et al. in 1953 for the in vivo B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions . In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double helix. Although the B-DNA form is most common under the conditions found in cells, it is not a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder. Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological conditions in partly dehydrated samples of DNA, while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form . Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, the opposite of the more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription. Alternative DNA chemistry For many years, exobiologists have proposed the existence of a shadow biosphere , a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life.

A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1 was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules. Quadruplex structures DNA quadruplex formed by telomere repeats. The looped conformation of the DNA backbone is very different from the typical DNA helix. The green spheres in the center represent potassium ions. At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres . The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase , as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3\u2032 ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells , telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence. These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases, known as a guanine tetrad , form a flat plate. These flat four-base units then stack on top of each other to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure. In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls", "source_type": "random"}

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop . Branched DNA Branched DNA can form networks containing multiple branches. In DNA, fraying occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below. Artificial bases Several artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named Hachimoji DNA . Dubbed S, B, P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a predictable way (S\u2013B and P\u2013Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and be transcribed to RNA. Their existence could be seen as an indication that there is nothing special about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth.

Acidity The phosphate groups of DNA give it similar acidic properties to phosphoric acid and it can be considered as a strong acid . It will be fully ionized at a normal cellular pH, releasing protons which leave behind negative charges on the phosphate groups. These negative charges protect DNA from breakdown by hydrolysis by repelling nucleophiles which could hydrolyze it. Macroscopic appearance Impure DNA extracted from an orange Pure DNA extracted from cells forms white, stringy clumps. Chemical modifications and altered DNA packaging Base modifications and DNA packaging Structure of cytosine with and without the 5-methyl group. Deamination converts 5-methylcytosine into thymine. The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin . Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling ). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression. For one example, cytosine methylation produces 5-methylcytosine , which is important for X-inactivation of chromosomes.

Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can deaminate to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to mutations . Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the brain , and the glycosylation of uracil to produce the \"J-base\" in kinetoplastids . Damage A covalent adduct between a metabolically activated form of benzopyrene , the major mutagen in tobacco smoke , and DNA DNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens , which change the DNA sequence . Mutagens include oxidizing agents , alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays . The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers , which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations , insertions , deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations .

DNA damages that are naturally occurring , due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging. Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called intercalation . Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide , acridines , daunomycin , and doxorubicin . For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens , and in the case of thalidomide, a teratogen . Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells. Biological functions Location of eukaryote nuclear DNA within the chromosomes DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes , and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes .

The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome ; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes . Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation , which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In an alternative fashion, a cell may copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication . The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome. Genomes Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA condensation , to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the cell nucleus , with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts . In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid . The functional genetic information in a genome is located in genes, regulatory sequences, origins of replication, centromeres, telomeres, and segments required for the three-dimensional structure of chromatin. In many complex eukaryotes, only a small fraction of the total sequence is devoted to the various functional elements. For example, in humans less than 10% of the genome has a defined functional role and the rest (90%) is probably junk DNA . (See also .)

Transcription and translation A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation , known collectively as the genetic code . The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g., ACT, CAG, TTT). In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase . This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA , which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4 3 combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids , giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAG, TAA, and TGA codons, (UAG, UAA, and UGA on the mRNA). Replication DNA replication: The double helix is unwound by a helicase and topo\u00adiso\u00admerase . Next, one DNA polymerase produces the leading strand copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the lagging strand . This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called Okazaki fragments ) before DNA ligase joins them together.

Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase . This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA. Extracellular nucleic acids Naked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2 \u03bcg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 \u03bcg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer ; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.

Interactions with proteins All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important. DNA-binding proteins Interaction of DNA (in orange) with histones (in blue). These proteins' basic amino acids bind to the acidic phosphate groups on DNA. Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin . In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones , while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome , which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation , phosphorylation , and acetylation . These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into", "source_type": "random"}

Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes. A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases . The lambda repressor helix-turn-helix transcription factor bound to its DNA target In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors , which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase. As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to \"read\" the DNA sequence.

DNA-modifying enzymes Nucleases and ligases The restriction enzyme EcoRV (green) in a complex with its substrate DNA Nucleases are enzymes that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds . Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called exonucleases , while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases , which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5\u2032-GATATC-3\u2032 and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the restriction modification system . In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting . Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands. Ligases are particularly important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination . Topoisomerases and helicases Topoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand", "source_type": "random"}

Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription. Helicases are proteins that are a type of molecular motor . They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates , predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases. Polymerases Polymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates . The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains\u2014which are called templates . These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use. In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides.

In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases . RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase , which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses , and telomerase , which is required for the replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage. Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator , where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II , the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.

The four separate DNA strands are coloured red, blue, green and yellow. A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called \" chromosome territories \". This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in chromosomal crossover which occurs during sexual reproduction , when genetic recombination occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin. Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks. The most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination , where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences.

The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction , in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north\u2013south cleavage. The north\u2013south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east\u2013west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes. Evolution DNA contains the genetic information that allows all forms of life to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes .

This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial. Building blocks of DNA ( adenine , guanine , and related organic molecules ) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space . Complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life , including uracil , cytosine , and thymine , have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space , using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine , found in meteorites . Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe , may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds. Ancient DNA has been recovered from ancient organisms at a timescale where genome evolution can be directly observed, including from extinct organisms up to millions of years old, such as the woolly mammoth .

They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector . The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins , used in medical research , or be grown in agriculture . DNA profiling Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood , semen , skin , saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed DNA profiling , also called DNA fingerprinting . In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites , are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys , and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case. The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury.

This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime. DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents, bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members. DNA profiling is also used in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Usually DNA sequencing are carried out after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant. DNA enzymes or catalytic DNA Deoxyribozymes , also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA, were first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated from a large pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which have been used to detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific).

Bioinformatics Bioinformatics involves the development of techniques to store, data mine , search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science , especially string searching algorithms , machine learning , and database theory . String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment , are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project , are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.

DNA nanotechnology is the field that seeks to design nanoscale structures using the molecular recognition properties of DNA molecules. DNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra . Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins. DNA and other nucleic acids are the basis of aptamers , synthetic oligonucleotide ligands for specific target molecules used in a range of biotechnology and biomedical applications. History and anthropology Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny . This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology . If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology . Information storage DNA as a storage device for information has enormous potential since it has much higher storage density compared to electronic devices. However, high costs, slow read and write times ( memory latency ), and insufficient reliability has prevented its practical use.

DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it \"nuclein\". In 1878, Albrecht Kossel isolated the non-protein component of \"nuclein\", nucleic acid, and later isolated its five primary nucleobases . In 1909, Phoebus Levene identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide unit of RNA (then named \"yeast nucleic acid\"). In 1929, Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in \"thymus nucleic acid\" (DNA). Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups (\"tetranucleotide hypothesis\"). Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In 1927, Nikolai Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a \"giant hereditary molecule\" made up of \"two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template\". In 1928, Frederick Griffith in his experiment discovered that traits of the \"smooth\" form of Pneumococcus could be transferred to the \"rough\" form of the same bacteria by mixing killed \"smooth\" bacteria with the live \"rough\" form. This system provided the first clear suggestion that DNA carries genetic information.

At the time, \"yeast nucleic acid\" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while \"thymus nucleic acid\" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH. In 1937, William Astbury produced the first X-ray diffraction patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure. In 1943, Oswald Avery , along with co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty , identified DNA as the transforming principle , supporting Griffith's suggestion ( Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment ). Erwin Chargaff developed and published observations now known as Chargaff's rules , stating that in DNA from any species of any organism, the amount of guanine should be equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine should be equal to thymine . A blue plaque outside The Eagle pub in Cambridge, England commemorating Crick and Watson By 1951, Alec Todd and collaborators at the University of Cambridge had determined by biochemical methods how the backbone of DNA is structured via the successive linking of carbon atoms 3 and 5 of the sugar to phosphates. This would help to corroborate Watson and Crick's later X-ray structural work. Todd would later be awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and other discoveries related to DNA. Late in 1951, Francis Crick started working with James Watson at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge. DNA's role in heredity was confirmed in 1952 when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment showed that DNA is the genetic material of the enterobacteria phage T2 .

Photo 51 , showing X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA In May 1952, Raymond Gosling , a graduate student working under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin , took an X-ray diffraction image, labeled as \" Photo 51 \", at high hydration levels of DNA. This photo was given to Watson and Crick by Maurice Wilkins and was critical to their obtaining the correct structure of DNA. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside. Before then, Linus Pauling, and Watson and Crick, had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Franklin's identification of the space group for DNA crystals proved her correct. In February 1953, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside. Watson and Crick completed their model, which is now accepted as the first correct model of the double helix of DNA . On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at The Eagle pub in Cambridge, England to announce that he and Watson had \"discovered the secret of life\". Pencil sketch of the DNA double helix by Francis Crick in 1953 The 25 April 1953 issue of the journal Nature published a series of five articles giving the Watson and Crick double-helix structure DNA and evidence supporting it. The structure was reported in a letter titled \" MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid \" , in which they said, \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\" This letter was followed by a letter from Franklin and Gosling,", "source_type": "random"}

Then followed a letter by Wilkins and two of his colleagues, which contained an analysis of in vivo B-DNA X-ray patterns, and which supported the presence in vivo of the Watson and Crick structure. In April 2023, scientists, based on new evidence, concluded that Rosalind Franklin was a contributor and \"equal player\" in the discovery process of DNA, rather than otherwise, as may have been presented subsequently after the time of the discovery. In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery. In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the central dogma of molecular biology , which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the \"adaptor hypothesis\". Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment . Further work by Crick and co-workers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons , allowing Har Gobind Khorana , Robert W. Holley , and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code. These findings represent the birth of molecular biology .

Until electric rice cookers came into common use in the 20th century, rice in Japan was cooked in a kamado , a traditional stove heated by wood or charcoal. Because regulating the heat of a wood or charcoal fire is more difficult, a layer of rice at the bottom of the pot would often be slightly burned during cooking; this layer, called okoge , was not discarded, but was eaten with vegetables or moistened with water, soup, or tea. Okoge is still eaten in Japanese cuisine, and is an important part of the kaiseki meal served at tea ceremonies , where it is typically served with hot water and pickles as the final course. It has a crispy texture and a nutty flavour. Because the cooking temperature of modern electric rice cookers is precisely controlled, okoge does not usually form naturally during the cooking process. However, there are rice cookers on the market in Japan that have an okoge setting. Okoge can also be made by scorching cooked rice in a frying pan.

Note that the latter method does not work for bcc'd e-mails and some mailing lists, as the recipient cannot be easily identified by looking at the e-mail headers . However, failed e-mail can be delivered to a central account, where the correct recipient can be identified manually and then distributed accordingly by the administrator. The software is then scheduled to fetch e-mail at regular intervals, from once every 24 hours right down to once every 5 minutes (SBS 2008). If the situation requires it, an immediate download can be started from the configuration screen. There are non-supported workarounds to shorten the fetch interval, such as on SBS 2003 creating the new DWORD value ScheduleAccelerator in the registry folder \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SmallBusinessServer\\Network\\POP3 Connector\". The new fetch interval time becomes the amount specified in the configuration GUI, divided by the value set for ScheduleAccelerator. For example, if the user sets the interval in the GUI to 15 minutes, and the ScheduleAccelerator value is set to 3, it will fetch e-mail every 5 minutes. In SBS 2008 the program Pop3Connector.exe in \"%programfiles%\\Windows Small Business Server\\Bin\" can fetch e-mail instantly by using the argument -downloadNow.

It is often used to intimidate the opposition and/or make them less confident in their ability to win, but it can also be used in a humorous spirit. Trash-talk is often characterized by the use of hyperbole or figurative language, such as \"Your team can't run! You run like honey on ice!\" Puns and other wordplay are commonly used. Trash-talk has become a debatable term, especially in North American sports, with the greatest trash talkers being acknowledged for both their trash-talking skills as well as their athletic and mental abilities. For example, Larry Bird is regarded as a prolific trash talker and was known for his athletic ability backing up his trash talk. Usage In sports, trash talk most commonly comes in the form of insults to an opposing player's playing ability or physical appearance which is ethically not acceptable. The intended effects of trash talk are to create rivalry between the players and increase the psychological pressure of opposing players to perform well or to stop the trash-talker from performing well. Trash talk was most famously used by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 70s. In 1963, Ali even released a popular full-length record album consisting largely of trash-talk poetry. It was entitled I Am the Greatest! , a phrase that became his signature line. Since then, it has become common for boxers, wrestlers , and many other sports competitors to use trash talk. However, in amateur sports ranks, trash-talking is generally frowned upon as unsportsmanlike conduct (especially in youth leagues).

Former UFC Featherweight and Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor is an example of a prominent trash-talker; he is considered to be the greatest trash-talker in MMA history. Former UFC fighter Chael Sonnen is also considered by many to be one of the greatest trash-talkers MMA has ever had. Although the practice of trying to distract opponents with verbal abuse is common to virtually all sports, other sports sometimes have their terminology for verbal abuse: for example, cricket calls it sledging and in ice hockey, it is called chirping. The quality of performance of players under the pressure of trash talk is debated, but one study found that participants who were subject to a trash talk message exerted more effort in completing their task and perceived their opponent with more incivility and rivalry when compared to participants who were subject to a neutral, irrelevant, or no message at all. While trash-talking frequently focuses on sporting attributes such as physical ability and athleticism, there is also significant trash-talking off-topic including opponent's sexual behavior and relationships. Zinedine Zidane infamously head-butted Marco Materazzi during the 2006 World Cup Final after Materazzi had leveled a puerile insult about Zidane's sister during a verbal exchange a few moments prior. Trash-talk is more prevalent in contact sports than non-contact sports, and it is also more prevalent between male competitors than female competitors.

Talking shit Look up talking shit in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Talking shit is a term and type of trash-talk that refers to various types of derogatory language aimed at an individual or any type of entity, such as a group or organisation. Talking shit can be used as a tactic in fighting or brawling, used to draw attention to the matter among onlookers. This is a term that has been coined more recently and is used in reference when someone talks negatively about another person, concept, organisation, or entity. This may or may not include spreading false ideas. The same term can also be used to describe something spoken which is not true, uninteresting or irrelevant. It may be a contraction of \" talking bullshit \". Talking shit has also shown to motivate the opponent. In a 2017 article Maurice Schweitzer wrote: When people have to exert effort within a competition, some people engage in trash-talking, such as \"You're a loser. That dollar is mine or I\u2019m going to beat you like a rented mule.\" When people are the targets of these kind of messages, what we find is that they become much more motivated.", "source_type": "random"}

That dollar is mine or I\u2019m going to beat you like a rented mule.\" When people are the targets of these kind of messages, what we find is that they become much more motivated. They increase their effort and the performance goes up. Indeed, one key finding of our work is that targets of trash-talking become very motivated. We ran some other studies to show that sometimes they become even so motivated they're likely to engage in unethical behavior to win. So, what people care about is outperforming this person who's trash-talking them. They're willing to both expend constructive effort but also engage in unethical behavior to make sure they outperform their competitor. Talking shit is not to be confused with shitposting , which is when someone posts \"content aggressively , ironically , and trollishly poor quality\" to an online forum . Morality The ethics of using trash talk as a strategy is debated. In sports, trash talking is often seen as unsportsmanlike, as throwing insults at opposing players goes beyond the limits and conventions of the game. Some argue, on the other hand, that trash-talking can be used as a valid strategy to increase tension in opponents and thus benefit from opponents' poor performance since any action not explicitly banned in the rules is permitted. According to a research project conducted by Marcus Fennel, a graduate student at the University of Idaho, trash talk decreases sportsmanship and instead promotes gamesmanship. Fennel describes gamesmanship as \"the anti-ethical version of sportsmanship\". Trash talking has the ability to diminish a player's motivation, which in turn could cause them to lose a love for their sport.

The deliberate use of words to diminish an athlete's self-confidence is an act of immorality and adds great credibility to the debate on why trash talking should be limited. In popular culture Given the rapid increase in the popularity of the phrase, its appearance in popular media and culture is extensive. One of the earliest references can be found in Dobie Gray 's hit song from 1965, \" The 'In' Crowd \", in which the third verse describes members \"spendin' cash, talkin' trash\" as part of the depiction of a desirable group membership.

It is played with a specially designed deck of 108 cards. The game, designed by Phil Foglio and James Ernest , takes its theme from the \"gaslamp fantasy\" of the Girl Genius comic book series. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points by \"popping\" cards out of a two-dimensional layout. Unlike most games published by Cheapass Games at that time, Girl Genius: The Works has high-quality laminated cards with detailed designs. It was nominated for two Origins Awards (Best Abstract Card Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game) in 2001, but did not win in either category. (The awards went to Cosmic Coasters and Zombies!!! , respectively.) Mechanics Girl Genius: The Works uses gaming mechanics similar to those in the collectible card game XXXenophile , based on Foglio's earlier graphic-novel work. XXXenophile 's gameplay is largely the same as the present game's, except that the former has each player compose a deck from the pool of 270 available cards, while the latter has a fixed 108-card deck. XXXenophile went out of print. Other differences include the removal of CCG aspects and continuous-effect card types like Gizmos and Settings. The focus is also less prurient .

Each card in the game has symbols along each of its four edges. The symbols, which come in five types, range in number from one to eight. Each card also has a point value between 0 and 9, and most of the cards have instructions which must be followed when the card is popped. The game starts with the laying out of 12 cards in a lattice pattern (\"the Works\"), all face-down, except for two corner cards which are positioned face-up. Each player starts with a hand of five cards, and a score pile, which is initially empty. The players then take their turns in order around the table. Each turn consists of five stages: Flip a card. If there are any face-down cards in the Works, flip one face-up. Spin a card. Pick up any one face-up card, spin it 180 degrees, and put it back in its place. Check. Consider in turn each of the four edges of the card you just spun. If the type of symbol on an edge matches the type of the symbol on the neighboring card's edge, then the card with the more symbols \"pops\" out of the Works. If they have the same number of symbols, both cards pop. Replace cards. Any blank spaces in the Works created by removing cards on this turn are now filled with new cards from the hand of the player who created the blank space. The new cards are always placed face-up, except as detailed in the instruction for \"B\u00e4renk\u00f6nig,\" whose replacement is played face-down. (If the replacing player runs out of cards, then she must draw cards from the draw pile one at a time to finish the replacement stage.) Draw cards.

(In other words, the current set of popped cards forms a stack .) Game end The game ends as soon as one player has 100 points or more in her score pile, based on the point values of the cards and any complicating factors such as \"Dr. Monahan's Diabolical Rat-Stretching Engine\". This may happen even in the middle of another player's turn. The game also ends immediately if a player manages to pop a \"Racing Dirigible \" while there are two Submarines in his score pile, or a Submarine when there are three Dirigibles in his score pile. In that case, the player who popped the card immediately wins, regardless of anyone else's score.

It is the worst air crash in Norwegian history. Arktikugol , the owner of the company town of Barentsburg, operates a Mil Mi-8 helicopter from the heliport at Heerodden, 2 kilometres (1 mi) outside of town, as well as a heliport at their former town of Pyramiden . During the Cold War , Aeroflot retained a large helicopter base at Heerodden, operating five Mi-8 which could quickly be retrofitted with arms, plus regular staff both at Svalbard Airport (for occasional charter flights) and Heerodden. In 2006, one helicopter was lost in the Heerodden helicopter accident . Railways Narrow-gauge mining railways used to operate at a number of locations, in particular at Ny-\u00c5lesund and Grumant (built by the Norwegians and Soviets respectively). Most of these railways have been abandoned, but the one at Barentsburg was reported as still functional in 2008.

His date of birth was reported late and is erroneously stated as 1923 in most publications. When an international exhibition was held in France in 1989 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, Moon was one of 24 artists who were invited. One of his pieces can be found in SOMA sculptor park celebrating the 1988 Summer Olympics Seoul . Biography Born in Takeo , Japan , his family moved to his father's hometown, Masan in current Gyeongsangnam-do . Since his mother's family never accepted the existence of his father, he had to set apart from her at 5. In need, he worked as a laborer in Tokyo , studying Occidental painting in Nihon art college since he was 16. After independence of Korea, he refused to participate in Korean national art exhibition given that the foundation was conservative in his viewpoint. Later, he joined the \"Modern art association\" of major artists notably such as Yoo Youngguk, Park go seok and Han muk in 1957 before he decided to leave for Paris . He died of gastric cancer in 1995. Work He moved to Paris in 1961 at first. His study in Paris encouraged him to immerse in modern art, which made him get into abstract paintings or sculptures focusing on wood materials. This period is meaningful in that the artist widened his work space in arts. After a two-year stay in Seoul , he returned to Paris.

After a two-year stay in Seoul , he returned to Paris. This time he paid attention to large-scale sculptors in abstract and imaginary structures, which called for invitation of several exhibition across Europe. The outdoor exhibition in Le Barcar\u00e8s brought him international fame starting in Europe. After coming back to Paris, his pieces achieved unique style in forms of symmetry, such as shapes of plants or creatures to fascinatingly demonstrate vitality. His pieces represent the beauty of Korean tradition through bilateral symmetry with images of life. Although early pieces during Moon's second term in France didn't have definite titles such as \u3008Piece\u3009\u00b7\u3008Sculptor\u3009\u00b7\u3008Untitled\u3009, exact titles started to be presented at later phase. This period provided him with a series of great opportunity to introduce pieces in Italy , Switzerland , Germany and so on. Returning to South Korea in 1980, he settled in Masan, his hometown, eagerly focusing on sculptors made of bronze, stainless metal. The difference from his anterior period was ingredients: He started to use much thicker materials such as ebony and pine trees. His philosophy comes from the idea that all the creatures hold the concept of symmetry and harmony in nature. Strong materials such as iron and metal drove him to accomplish his original objective. His pieces show through patterns of Korean arts from the early 1950s and 1960s to mature abstract paintings until the early 1990s. Honors He constructed an art center by himself in Masan to commemorate his art pieces, coming after honorable degree of literature from Kyungnam University . The French government honoured Moon by celebrating his artwork to enhance interchange relationship between Korean and French modern art. Notably, his works were invited to several exhibitions: invitation exhibition of Paris art center in 1990; Hungarian Natural History Museum in 1991; retrospective exhibition in Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1992).

Dayanand Saraswati ( pronunciation \u24d8 ) born Mool Shankar Tiwari (12 February 1824 \u2013 30 October 1883), was a Hindu philosopher , social leader and founder of the Arya Samaj , a reform movement of Hinduism . His book Satyarth Prakash has remained one of the influential texts on the philosophy of the Vedas and clarifications of various ideas and duties of human beings. He was the first to give the call for Swaraj as \"India for Indians\" in 1876, a call later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak . Denouncing the idolatry and ritualistic worship, he worked towards reviving Vedic religion.

He emphasised the Vedic ideals of brahmacharya , including celibacy and devotion to God . Among Dayananda's contributions were his opposition to untouchability , promotion of the equal rights for women and his commentary on the Vedas from Vedic Sanskrit in Sanskrit as well as in Hindi . Early life Dayananda Saraswati was born on the 10th day of waning moon in the month of Purnimanta Phalguna (12 February 1824) on the tithi to an Indian Hindu Brahmin family in Tankara , Kathiawar region (now Morbi district of Gujarat ). He belonged to the Audichya Brahmin sub-division. His original name was Mool Shankar Tiwari, because he was born in Dhanu Rashi and Mul Nakshatra . His father was Karshanji Lalji Tiwari, and his mother was Yashodabai. When he was eight years old, his Yajnopavita Sanskara ceremony was performed, marking his entry into formal education. His father was a follower of Shiva and taught him the ways to worship Shiva. He was also taught the importance of keeping fasts.

The deaths of his younger sister and his uncle from cholera led Dayananda to ponder the meaning of life and death. He began asking questions which worried his parents. He was engaged in his early teens, but he decided marriage was not for him and ran away from home in 1846. Dayanand Saraswati spent nearly twenty-five years, from 1845 to 1869, as a wandering ascetic, searching for religious truth. He found out that the joy from material goods was not enough, therefore he decided to devote himself to spiritual pursuits in forests, retreats in the Himalayans , and pilgrimage sites in North India. During these years he practised various forms of yoga and became a disciple of a teacher named Virajanand Dandeesha . Virajanand believed that Hinduism had strayed from its historical roots and that many of its practices had become impure. Dayananda Sarasvati promised Virajanand that he would devote his life to restoring the rightful place of the Vedas in the Hindu faith.

He said that these texts are not valid as they teach different customs, rituals, and practices which are against the Vedas. Dayanand based his teachings on the Vedas, which can be summarised as follows: three entities are eternal: 1. The Supreme Lord or Paramatma, 2. The Souls or Jivatmas, which are vast in number but not infinite, 3. Prakriti or Nature. Prakriti or Nature, which is the material cause of the creation, is eternal and is characterised by Sattva , Rajas , and Tamas , which tend to be in equilibrium. In every cycle of creation, the conscious Supreme Lord will disturb its equilibrium and make it useful for the creation of the World and its forces and to manufacture the bodies required by the Souls. After a specific time called the Day of Brahma (Brahma means great, lengthy, etc.), the creation would be dissolved, and nature would be restored to its equilibrium. After a period called the Night of Brahma, which is equal to the length of the Day of Brahma, the creation would set forth again. This cycle of creation and dissolution is eternal.

These souls are subtler than Nature itself but take birth through the body as per the creative principles set by the Supreme Lord based on their past Karma, and they put effort into improving themselves. By realising oneself, Nature, and the Supreme Lord, Souls are liberated. But this realisation depends on their efforts and knowledge. They keep coming to the World, use Nature, obtain the fruits of their actions, and appear to take of lives of different animals (Those who have attained higher bodies can also go back to lower forms based on their actions or Karma), they redo their actions, and are free to choose their actions, learn and relearn, and attain Liberation. After the long duration of Moksha or Liberation, one would come back again into the World. Since this period of Moksha or Liberation is long, it appears as though they never return or they never take birth again, to the other beings who are still in the World. Since they are eternal and capable of working, these characteristics cannot be destroyed. They are timeless, eternal, but are not omniscient and hence cannot be the pervaders of the entire Space.

The Supreme Lord is bodiless, infinite, hence has no form and hence cannot be worshipped through idols but can only be reached by any being through Yogic Samadhi as advocated in the Vedas, which is summarised in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali . Since the Lord is bodiless and hence beyond all sexes, the Vedas address him as Father, Mother, Friend, Cause of the Worlds, Maker, etc He is the subtlest entity which is subtler than Nature, pervading and filling the entire existence and Space. It is due to his subtlety that he could take hold of Nature to create the Worlds, and he proposes no difficulty for the motion of the Worlds in Space. Hence, he is called Paramatman , which means 'Ultimate Pervader\". There exists neither one who is equal to him nor completely opposed to him. The ideas of Satans, Ghosts, etc., are foreign to the Vedas.

The Jivas or Souls are characterised by four different states of existence, which are: 1. Jagrat (Wakefulness), 2. Swapna (Dreaming), 3. Sushupti (Deep Sleep) and 4. Turiya . It is in the fourth Turiya state that the Souls exist without contact with Nature but are conscious of their own selves, other Souls, and the Supreme Lord (or Eternal Truth). This state of Moksha or Turiya is not seen in the World, hence incomparable, but can only be realised. In this state, they are free of every tinge of Nature and possess their own minds and experience bliss, the pleasure of their freedom, and the like, which are incomparable with any form of pleasure in the World. They are bodiless in that state and can attain any form of pleasure by their own will without requiring any external agent, such as, for example, they can perform the function of ears on their own without requiring material ears, etc. In that state, they are capable of fulfilling all their wishes, can go anywhere they want right then and there, witness the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the Worlds, and they also come in contact with other individuals who are Liberated.

In Moksha, the Souls remain distinct from one another and from the Supreme Lord. And, by means of their own capability and with the Supreme Lord as their means, they enjoy the bliss. After the period of Moksha, they pass on to this World again, in support of which, he quotes Vedic Mantras and Mundaka Upanishad , in his book Satyarth Prakash and Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhumika . Again, it is the mark of Maharshi Dayanand's wit that he reconciles the notion of unending or eternal Moksha. He says, \"The 'Eternal Moksha' or 'Ananta Moksha', refers to the 'permanency of pleasures of Moksha', unlike the momentary pleasures of the World, and does not necessarily mean the Souls will remain in Moksha permanently.\" He clarifies it by saying that the Souls are permanent and hence their characteristics also, and it is 'illogical' to consider that a Soul would get trapped in one of the moments of the beginningless time, and escape the World for eternity by using the finite time period of his lives in different creature forms. Even if the illogical is accepted, then also it means that even before he got trapped in creation, he was in Moksha, and hence his Moksha period may fail at times is a conclusion that is contradictory to the assumption that Moksha is an infinite period of time.

He opposed caste system , Sati practice , child marriage , etc. which are against the spirit of the Vedas and advocated that all evils of society should be thoroughly investigated and should be removed. The Varna should be based on education and profession, and in his book Satyarth Prakash , he quotes passages from Manusmriti , Grihya Sutras , and Vedas which support his claims. He advocated the notion of Chakradhipatya (One Government Throughout the World). Dayanand's mission Aum or Om is considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God. He believed that Hinduism had been corrupted by divergence from the founding principles of the Vedas and that Hindus had been misled by the priesthood for the priests' self-aggrandisement. For this mission, he founded the Arya Samaj , enunciating the Ten Universal Principles called Krinvanto Vishwaryam . With these principles, he intended the whole world to be an abode for Aryas (Nobles). His next step was to reform Hinduism with a new dedication to God. He travelled the country challenging religious scholars and priests to discussions, winning repeatedly through the strength of his arguments and knowledge of Sanskrit and Vedas.

Hindu priests discouraged the laity from reading Vedic scriptures, and encouraged rituals, such as bathing in the Ganges and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as superstitions or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to return to the teachings of the Vedas, and to follow the Vedic way of life. He also exhorted Hindus to accept social reforms, including the importance of cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of Hindi as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired Hindus to aspire for Swarajya (self-governance), nationalism, and spiritualism. He advocated the equal rights and respects to women and advocated for the education of all children, regardless of sex. Dayanand also made critical analyses of faiths including Christianity and Islam , as well as of other Indian faiths like Jainism , Buddhism and Sikhism . In addition to discouraging idolatry in Hinduism, he was also against what he considered to be the corruption of the true and pure faith in his own country. Unlike many other reform movements of his times within Hinduism, the Arya Samaj's appeal was addressed not only to the educated few in India, but to the world as a whole as evidenced in the sixth principle of the Arya Samaj. As a result, his teachings professed universalism for all the living beings and not for any particular sect, faith, community or nation. Arya Samaj allows and encourages converts to Hinduism.

In the Ten Universal Principles of the Arya Samaj, he enshrined the idea that \"All actions should be performed with the prime objective of benefiting mankind\", as opposed to following dogmatic rituals or revering idols and symbols. The first five principles speak of Truth, while the last five speak of a society with nobility, civics, co-living, and disciplined life. In his own life, he interpreted Moksha to be a lower calling, as it argued for benefits to the individual, rather than calling to emancipate others.

He argued that all of these practices ran contrary to good sense and the wisdom of the Vedas . Views on superstitions He severely criticised practices which he considered to be superstitions, including sorcery, and astrology, which were prevalent in India at the time.

In his book Satyarth Prakash , Maharshi Dayanand has analysed critically current form of Hinduism , Jainism , Buddhism , Christianity and Islam . Islam He viewed Islam to be waging wars and immorality. He doubted that Islam had anything to do with the God, and questioned why a God would hate every non-believer, allowing the slaughter of animals, and command Muhammad to slaughter innocent people. He further described Muhammad as \"imposter\", and one who held out \"a bait to men and women, in the name of God, to compass his own selfish needs.\" He regarded Qur'an as \"Not the Word of God. It is a human work. Hence it cannot be believed in.\" Christianity His analysis of the Bible was based on an attempt to compare it with scientific evidence, morality, and other properties. His analysis claimed that the Bible contains many stories and precepts that are immoral, praising cruelty, deceit and that encourage sin. One commentary notes many alleged discrepancies and fallacies of logic in the Bible e.g. that God fearing Adam eating the fruit of life and becoming his equal displays jealousy. His critique attempts to show logical fallacies in the Bible, and throughout he asserts that the events depicted in the Bible portray God as a man rather than an omniscient, omnipotent or complete being.

He further said that followers of Sikhism are to be blamed for making up stories that Nanak possessed miraculous powers and met God. He criticised Guru Gobind Singh and other Sikh Gurus, saying they \"invented fictitious stories\", although he also recognised Gobind Singh to be \"indeed a very brave man.\" Jainism He regarded Jainism as \"a most dreadful religion\", writing that Jains were intolerant and hostile towards the non-Jains. Buddhism Dayanand described Buddhism as \"anti-Vedic\" and \"atheistic.\" He noted that the type of \"salvation\" Buddhism prescribes, is attainable even to dogs and donkeys. He further criticised the Buddhist cosmology which says that Earth was not created. Assassination attempts Dayananda was subjected to many unsuccessful assassination attempts on his life. According to his supporters, he was poisoned on a few occasions, but due to his regular practice of Hatha Yoga he survived all such attempts. One story tells that attackers once attempted to drown him in a river, but Dayananda dragged the assailants into the river instead, though he released them before they drowned.

Dayananda went to the Maharaja's restroom during his stay and saw him with a dancing girl named Nanhi Jaan.

The show follows the game of Countdown , but presented in a comedy panel show format seen on 8 Out of 10 Cats , with the show being a crossover of the two. The show is hosted by 8 Out of 10 Cats host Jimmy Carr , with Rachel Riley and Susie Dent assuming their Countdown roles assisting with the game. During most of the run, the two teams had regular captains Jon Richardson and Sean Lock ; after Lock's death in 2021, his team has been led by a rotating series of guest captains while Richardson continues to be a regular captain (except when scheduling conflicts prevent him from appearing). History The formation of the crossover began as a series of specials, the first of which was broadcast on 2 January 2012, when Channel 4 orchestrated a special \"mash-up night\", merging two shows to form a special edition of the pair, as part of its 30th-anniversary celebrations. Amongst the programmes that were chosen to be merged for the evening of specials, production teams on Countdown and 8 Out of 10 Cats agreed to combine the two formats of their respective programmes \u2013 the crossover between the two formats meant that Countdown ' s arrangement of games would be interspersed with 8 Out of 10 Cats -style banter. As part of the merger, both Rachel Riley and Susie Dent assumed their roles from the programme, while Jimmy Carr took on the mantle of host, with both Sean Lock and Jon Richardson competing as contestants, and Joe Wilkinson joining Dent during the crossover's recording.

Format Each episode lasts one hour, including advertising breaks, although the January 2012 special lasted only 30 minutes. Since the first one-third of the programme is occupied in introducing the panel, and due to the comedy interspersed between and during rounds, the game does not consist of the standard 15 rounds. Carr asks each panellist if they have a 'mascot', and the panellist will then indulge in some prop comedy , usually showing off a ludicrous or impractical object and telling a humorous story. The first few specials had different numbers of rounds ranging from 7 to 10. In the first two full series of the show, there were either 8 or 9 rounds. The first three quarters of the show each contained a letters round and a numbers round; the last section had a letters round, a numbers round (if there was time) and a conundrum. More recent series featured rounds involving two contestants participating in humorous activities (usually for bonus points), such as being blindfolded and identifying props that were spelt with nine letters. The letters and numbers rounds are the same as in Countdown , and there are also \"Teatime Teasers\". The conundrums and teatime teasers typically contain sexual words or innuendos but with usually innocent answers, such as \"GONADTIP\" (clue: \"One way to become a parent\", answer: \"ADOPTING\"). Whilst the clock is ticking, as the contestants attempt to find a word within 30 seconds, Carr often takes part in some form of unusual or non-sequitur activity such as trying to get a dog through an obstacle course, stacking a house of cards or enticing a bird of prey to fly onto his arm.

Apart from during the first two specials, there are two contestants on each team, with Richardson and Lock as permanent guests through the episodes. After Lock's death in 2021, his place has been taken by varying guests. During some rounds, contestants all offer an answer, but only the best answer from each team counts. During some rounds, one player per team is nominated to answer. A celebrity appears in Dictionary Corner, and, after each numbers round, they present a poem, song or another comedic segment. Susie Dent's \"Origin of Words\" section does not appear but is instead replaced with an additional segment from the guest. In earlier episodes, Joe Wilkinson appeared as Riley's assistant in the second half of the show, often dressed in costume whilst using props. The humour continued throughout the series, such as Wilkinson offering special prizes, replacing letter tiles with symbols, or turning up despite having been \"fired\". The teams compete for a different low-value prize each edition, such as \"The Countdown Paddling Pool\" or \"The Countdown Picnic Hamper\", parodying the teapot and dictionary prizes given in the real Countdown.

They have round cells, called cocci (singular coccus), or rod-like forms (bacillus). A few Bacillota, such as Megasphaera , Pectinatus , Selenomonas , and Zymophilus from the class Negativicutes , have a porous pseudo-outer membrane that causes them to stain Gram-negative . Many Bacillota produce endospores , which are resistant to desiccation and can survive extreme conditions. They are found in various environments, and the group includes some notable pathogens. Those in one family, the Heliobacteria , produce energy through anoxygenic photosynthesis . Bacillota play an important role in beer, wine, and cider spoilage. Taxonomy The renaming of phyla such as Firmicutes in 2021 remains controversial among microbiologists, many of whom continue to use the earlier names of long standing in the literature. The name \"Firmicutes\" was derived from the Latin words for 'tough skin', referring to the thick cell wall typical of bacteria in this phylum. Scientists once classified the Firmicutes to include all Gram-positive bacteria, but have recently defined them to be of a core group of related forms called the low- G+C group, in contrast to the Actinomycetota . The group is typically divided into the Clostridia , which are anaerobic , and the Bacilli , which are obligate or optional aerobes . On phylogenetic trees , the first two groups show up as paraphyletic or polyphyletic , as do their main genera, Clostridium and Bacillus .

The phylum Bacillota as part of the gut microbiota has been shown to be involved in energy resorption, and potentially related to the development of diabetes and obesity . In multiple studies a higher abundance of Bacillota has been found in obese individuals than in lean controls. A higher relative abundance of Bacillota was seen in mice fed a western diet (high fat/high sugar) than in mice fed a standard low fat/ high polysaccharide diet.

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) is a member of the Bacillota phylum that may have anti-inflammatory effects in humans . This species is associated with reduced low-grade inflammation in obesity. Additionally, patients with inflammatory bowel disease tend to have lower levels of F. prausnitzii. Pathogenicity Several Bacillota species are common human pathogens. Examples include Bacillus anthracis, Clostridioides difficile , and Clostridium botulinum . Others, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis , are opportunistic pathogens that cause illness in a minority of their hosts. Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly common problem with these infections. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is estimated to cause 100,000 deaths per year.

The hyponomic sinus, through which the funnel projects, appears to be trilobate. The siphuncle begins orthochoanitic (segments straight tubular) and central, becoming cyrtochoanitic (segments inflated) and subcentral with growth. Endosiphuncular deposits tend to grow forward, normally completed annularly at the septal foramina (openings) before fusing ventrally. Cameral deposits are mural, and heavier ventrally and dorsally. Dolorthoceras is recognized as a pseudorthocerid, nautiloid cephalopods that resemble but are not true orthocerids. It is assigned to the family Spyroceratidae along with such genera as Spyroceras , Adnatoceras , and Euloxoceras . Orientation during life was horizontal, as indicated by the cameral and endosiphuncular deposits. The animal may have been somewhat squid-like morphologically, but its behavior was probably not at all squid-like.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York continued to regularly provide liquidity to the repo market until June 2020. The causes of the rate spike were not immediately clear. Economists later identified its main cause to be a temporary shortage of cash available in the financial system , which was itself caused by two events taking place on September 16: the deadline for the payment of quarterly corporate taxes and the issuing of new Treasury securities .

The effects of this temporary shortage were exacerbated by declining level of reserves in the banking system. Other contributing factors have been suggested by economists and observers. Background Overnight lending Banks and financial institutions analyze their cash reserves on a daily basis, and assess whether they have an excess or a deficit of cash with respect to their needs. Banks that do not have sufficient cash to meet their liquidity needs borrow it from banks and money market funds with excess cash. This type of lending generally takes place overnight, which means that the cash is repaid the next day. The repo market Repurchase agreements, commonly referred to as repos, are a type of loans that are collateralized by securities and are generally provided for a short period of time. Although repos are economically equivalent to secured loans , they are legally structured as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. There are two steps in a repo transaction. First, the borrower sells their securities to the lender and receives cash in exchange. Second, the borrower repurchases the securities from the lender by repaying the cash amount they received plus an additional amount, which is the interest . This structure allows lenders to provide loans with very little risk , and borrowers to borrow at low rates. The repo market is used by banks, financial institutions and institutional investors to borrow cash to meet their overnight liquidity needs or to finance positions in the market. In this context, the repurchased securities are most often Treasury securities , but can also be agency securities and mortgage-backed securities . The broad measure of the interest rate for overnight loans collateralized by Treasury securities is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . The daily volume of repo transactions is generally estimated to be around $1 trillion; hence, according to economists at the Bank for International Settlements , \"any sustained disruption in this market could quickly ripple through the financial system\".

The U.S. repo market is broadly divided into two segments: the tri-party market and the bilateral market. The tri-party market involves large, high-quality dealers borrowing cash from money market funds. This segment is called \"tri-party\" because a third party, the bank BNY Mellon , provides various services to market participants. The bilateral market involves large dealers lending to borrowers, such as smaller dealers and hedge funds . A common practice is for dealers to borrow cash on the tri-party market to lend it to their clients on the bilateral market. The federal funds market The Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., which serves as the Federal Reserve System's headquarters. Federal funds are funds that are loaned or borrowed by financial institutions overnight to meet their liquidity needs. Unlike repos, federal funds are unsecured. According to economist Frederic Mishkin and finance professor Stanley Eakins , the term \"federal funds\" is misleading: \"federal funds have nothing to do with the federal government\", and \"he term comes from the fact that these funds are held at the Federal Reserve bank\". The repo market and the federal funds market are theoretically separate. However, there are significant links and interactions between the two, and shocks in one market can transmit themselves to the other. The interest rate on federal funds is an important component of U.S. monetary policy . To implement its monetary policy, the Federal Reserve 's Federal Open Market Committee determines a target range for the federal funds rate. Although the Federal Reserve cannot directly control the rate, which is primarily determined by the forces of supply and demand, it can influence it by adjusting the interest rate on reserve balances held by banks at the Federal Reserve, or by buying (or selling) securities from (or to) banks.

It is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Events Rates increase Before September 2019, both the SOFR and the EFFR were quite stable. The EFFR had remained within the FOMC's target range on all but one day since 2015. The SOFR was slightly more volatile, especially around quarter-end reporting dates, but had rarely moved more than 0.2 percentage points on a single day. On Monday, September 16, the SOFR was at 2.43 percent, an increase of 0.13 percentage points compared to the previous business day (Friday, September 13).

Response by the Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building at 33 Liberty Street as seen from the west Beginning on the morning of Tuesday, September 17, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or New York Fed) began to take action to restore market stability. Shortly after 9 a.m., it announced that it would begin to lend cash to borrowers on the repo market, in an amount of up to $75 billion. The New York Fed would accept as collateral Treasury securities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. Interest rates began to decrease shortly after the announcement. Most repo trading occurs early in the morning, and had therefore taken place before the New York Fed's announcement: as a result, only $53 billion was borrowed from the New York Fed by market participants. On the afternoon of September 17, repo rates remained relatively elevated, since market participants were uncertain whether the New York Fed would continue its intervention on the following days. These concerns were alleviated when the New York Fed announced at 8:15 a.m. the following morning (Wednesday, September 18) that it would conduct a second $75 billion overnight lending operation. Repo rates then stabilized and federal funds rates returned closer to the Federal Reserve's target range. On September 19, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered the interest rate paid on reserves balances held by banks, in an effort to lower the EFFR, which tends to trade slightly above the rate paid on bank reserves. This decision also reduced the chance that the EFFR would return to levels above the Federal Reserve's target range. Meanwhile, the New York Fed continued to lend a daily amount of $75 billion overnight to market participants every morning of the week, through Friday, September 20.

Aftermath The New York Fed continued to offer liquidity to market participants for several months, in an effort to control and limit volatility. In June 2020, the New York Fed tightened its operations on the repo market, after seeing \"substantial improvement\" in market condition. From June 2020, market participants stopped using the Fed's liquidity facility. In January 2021, the New York Fed discontinued its repo facility altogether, citing a \"sustained smooth functioning\" of the market. Suggested causes The cause of September 2019 market events was not immediately clear, with The Wall Street Journal characterizing the event as a \"mystery\". Over time, market observers and economists have suggested a combination of several factors as the causes of the rates hike. Temporary cash shortage The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues Treasury securities and collects federal taxes through the Internal Revenue Service . Two developments took place in mid-September that reduced the amount of cash available in the system and thus put stress on the overnight funding market. Firstly, quarterly corporate taxes were due on September 16, 2019. As a result, a substantial amount of cash was withdrawn from clients' accounts and was paid to the Treasury . Over a period of a few days, taxpayers withdrew more than $100 billion out of the banking system and money market funds to pay their taxes. This reduced the amount of cash available in the system and, specifically, in the repo market, since banks and money", "source_type": "random"}

This reduced the amount of cash available in the system and, specifically, in the repo market, since banks and money market funds generally lend their excess cash in the repo market. Secondly, new Treasury securities were settled on September 16, meaning that their price was paid by their purchasers on this date. The total amount paid by buyers in exchange for Treasury securities was $54 billion, which was withdrawn from their bank and money markets accounts. However, \" substantial share of newly issued Treasury debt is typically purchased by securities dealers, who then gradually sell the bonds to their customers.\" Between the moment dealers purchase newly issued Treasury securities and the moment they are able to sell them to customers, they finance their purchase by lending the securities on the repo market. Thus, there were more Treasury securities to be financed in the market on September 16, but less cash available to borrowers to purchase them. As a result, the increased rate for overnight funding seemed to stem from a temporary increase in the demand for cash and a simultaneous, temporary decline in the supply of cash, leading to a shortage of cash available in the system. Other causes The temporary cash shortage is nevertheless insufficient to explain the intensity of the movements observed in September 2019. The effects of the temporary cash shortage seemed to have been exacerbated by broader market trends. Declining bank reserves Treasury securities outstanding (the red line) versus reserve balances (the blue line) from January 2016 to February 2020 The events of September 2019 have been associated with the declining level of reserves in the banking system. \"Reserves\", in this context, means the cash held by banks in accounts at the central bank. The main function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other, generally as a way to settle transactions that have taken place between their customers.

The main function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other, generally as a way to settle transactions that have taken place between their customers. Reserves can be increased by government spending, which results in cash being transferred from government accounts to bank accounts. By contrast, the government can decrease reserves by selling government bonds , such as Treasury securities, to investors, which results in cash being transferred from bank accounts (and thus reserves) to government accounts. During and after the 2008 financial crisis , the Federal Reserve stimulated the economy by purchasing trillions of dollars of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities from banks and investors. As a result, reserves increased from around $10 billion at the end of 2007 to a peak of $2.8 trillion in 2014. In October 2017, the Federal Reserve began to reduce the size of its assets, most notably by stopping its purchases of Treasury securities and by letting its existing stock of Treasuries expire. As a result, reserves began to decline gradually, and financial institutions began to hold an increasing amount of Treasury securities themselves. According to economists at the Bank for International Settlement , this trend was particularly pronounced in the four main banks that are active as lenders in the repo market: since 2018, their holdings of liquid assets became increasingly skewed towards Treasury securities, which made it more difficult for them to lend their cash when demand rises. In mid-September 2019, the supply of reserves in the banking system amounted to $1.4 trillion, their lowest point since 2011. Economists and analysts have suggested that such a low amount of reserves may have exacerbated the liquidity shortage experienced on September 17.

Liquidity regulations require banks to hold a stock of liquid assets (such as cash) at all times to survive crisis scenarios, such as bank runs . Some economists have acknowledged that liquidity regulations may have prevented banks from lending more cash on the repo markets in September 2019, thus contributing to the cash shortage. Other researchers have taken a different view. They have argued that the inability of banks to deploy liquidity quickly to profit from the high rates was not caused by the liquidity regulations themselves, but by the more prudent risk-management framework put in place by banks after the 2007-08 crisis. They have also pointed out that other significant lenders on the repo market, such as money market funds and pension funds , were similarly reluctant to lend in mid-September 2019, despite not being subject to banking regulations. Other suggested causes Economists and market observers have suggested other factors as possible causes of the mid-September spike: the inelasticity of the demand for funding in the tri-party segment of the repo market, such that \"even small changes in the supply and demand for cash could result in large interest rate increases\", according to economists at the New York Fed The surprise caused by the sudden increase in interest rates on the morning of September 17, which may have led lenders to halt their lending until they could gather more information about the market conditions A general decrease in the amount of repo lending by money market funds beginning in August 2019, caused by a shift of the funds' portfolios to Treasury securities, which were expected to provide higher returns The increasing complexity of cash management at multinational U.S. banks See also Central banking Financial stability Money market Open market operation Notes and references Notes References Sources External links \"Historical Transaction Data \u2013 Repo &", "source_type": "random"}

If such a thing happened, the youth would put in his entry on some old dobbin released from plough a field....\" During the harsh winter of 1947, no one was daring enough to take part, and so one local farmer took it upon himself to lead a lone horse around the course, ensuring that the historic race would survive. The race normally takes 10 minutes to complete, but the farmer was contending with 4 feet (1.2 m) snowdrifts, and so had to often dismount and clear a path before taking his horse through. It took an hour and 20 minutes for him to complete the course. During the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth crisis the race was once again reduced to one horse and rider. In 2018 the race was cancelled after the course was waterlogged, and again a single horse was led round the course. The 2020 event was kept going by just two riders and their horses (Ferkin and Harry) because of the COVID-19 pandemic to preserve the race.

The company is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. PKWARE was founded in 1986 by Phil Katz , co-inventor of the ZIP standard. Thompson Street Capital Partners acquired PKWARE Inc. in 2020. History PKWare in Milwaukee, former Pittsburgh Plate Glass Enamel Plant Compression software (1986\u20132000) PKWARE was founded in 1986 by Phil Katz , a software developer who had begun distributing a new file compression utility, called PKARC, as shareware. PKARC represented a radical improvement over existing compression software (including the ARC utility, on which it was based) and gained popularity among individuals and corporations. Following a legal settlement with Systems Enhancement Associates Inc., the owners of ARC, Katz stopped distributing PKARC. He released, as an open format, his own compression program, which he called PKZIP , in January 10, 1989. PKZIP was the first program to use the new ZIP file format , which Katz developed in conjunction with Gary Conway and subsequently released into the public domain. PKWARE grew in its early years through business with large corporations. The ZIP format proved so popular that it became the de facto standard for data compression and remains in use throughout the world after more than 30 years. Purchase and expansion (2001\u20132008) After Katz died in 2000, his family sold the company to a new management team led by George Haddix and backed by investment-banking firm Grace Matthews. Two years later, the company acquired Ascent Solutions, a large-platform software firm based in Dayton, Ohio.

Shift toward data protection (2009\u20132015) A new ownership group including company management, Novacap Technologies, and Maranon Capital acquired PKWARE in 2009. The company's new CEO, V. Miller Newton, steered the company toward an increased focus on its encryption products in response to growing concerns about data security among PKWARE's customers in industries such as healthcare and government. In 2012, PKWARE released Viivo, a cloud storage encryption product to help customers secure data stored on Dropbox and other cloud storage services . Viivo received attention for having been developed outside of traditional methods in an effort toward \" disruptive innovation \" in the emerging cloud security market. Developing and purchasing expanded capabilities (2016\u2013present) PKWARE released Smartcrypt, a data protection platform combining encryption, data discovery, and encryption key management , in 2016. In 2018, PKWARE added Data Classification with Data Redaction to support PCI DSS compliance added one year later in 2019. PKWARE was purchased by Thompson Street Capital Partners in May 2020. After acquiring Dataguise in November 2020, the companies were merged under the single PKWARE name. Products from both legacy companies were renamed according to the new PK branding structure and the combined company received new branding to support the changes. These expanded capabilities enable PKWARE to offer data protection for structured data, unstructured data and semi-structured data .

The original Chinese Theatre was commissioned following the success of the nearby Grauman's Egyptian Theatre , which opened in 1922. Both were built as Exotic Revival style architecture. Built by a partnership headed by Sid Grauman over 18 months beginning in January 1926, the theater opened May 18, 1927, with the premiere of Cecil B. DeMille 's The King of Kings . It has since been home to many premieres, including the 1977 debut of Star Wars , as well as many private events and three Academy Awards ceremonies. Among the theater's features are the concrete blocks set in the forecourt, which bear the signatures, footprints, and handprints of popular motion picture personalities from the 1920s to the present day. Originally named Grauman's Chinese Theatre, it was renamed Mann's Chinese Theatre in 1973, and reverted to its original name in 2001. On January 11, 2013, Chinese electronics manufacturer TCL Corporation purchased the facility's naming rights for $5 million. In 2013, the Chinese Theatre collaborated with IMAX Corporation to convert the house into a custom-designed IMAX theater. Following the renovation, the theater seated 932 and featured one of the largest movie screens in North America. History Beginnings In March 1923, a meeting occurred at the offices of Fox West Coast Theatres where Sid Grauman , Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks , and several other executives discussed plans for a new US$1 million venue that would be dedicated to \"the spoken drama \" with films only being screened on rare occasions.

Although the project called for immediate construction, it was ultimately shelved for three years. In that time, several of its aspects were altered, including a change in scope from play house to movie theater due to the increasing profitability of motion pictures. The theatre under construction in 1926. The Garden Court Apartments is in the foreground. Grauman, a theater mogul who previously founded the Million Dollar Theater and Egyptian Theatre , moved forward with the plans for a new venue in 1925. Looking to build along Hollywood Boulevard, he leased the site of actor Francis X. Bushman 's mansion in a deal brokered by real estate developer Charles E. Toberman . In appreciation, a plaque was installed on the front of the theater dedicating it to Bushman. Los Angeles-based architecture firm Meyer & Holler , which previously collaborated with Grauman on the Egyptian, designed the \"palace-type\" Chinese Theatre. Raymond M. Kennedy served as principal architect on the project. In October 1925, local newspapers published an artist's impression of the planned theater's facade. The accounts promised a US$5 million cost as well as a \"tropical garden\" in the forecourt, complete with imported flowers, trees, and fish in ponds. In contrast to early reports, the theater cost $2.1 million to construct. Grauman co-owned the venue with Pickford, Fairbanks, Howard Schenck, and West Coast Theatres. Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1927 The groundbreaking ceremony for the Chinese Theatre occurred on the evening of January 5, 1926.

Newspapers heralded the public event as the founding of \"the world's most unusual playhouse\". Celebrities in attendance were included Grauman, Charlie Chaplin , Conrad Nagel , Norma Talmadge , and Anna May Wong . Talmadge and Wong turned the first spadeful of earth using a gold-plated shovel. Wong also put the first rivet into the structure of the theater. During construction, Grauman hired Jean Klossner to formulate an extremely hard concrete for the forecourt of the theater. Klossner later became known as \"Mr. Footprint\", performing the footprint ceremonies from 1927 through 1957. Many stories exist to explain the origins of the footprints. The theater's official account credits Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast of a radio adaptation of A Star Is Born , Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was \"pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was.

Still another account by Klossner recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. (Note: In 1949, Klossner's story changed to say that Grauman had accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. ) The theater's third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity after Talmadge to be immortalized in the concrete. In 1929, Grauman decided to retire and sell his share to William Fox 's Fox Theatres chain. However, just a few months later, Howard Hughes convinced Grauman to return to the theater, because he wanted Grauman to produce the world premiere of his aviation epic Hell's Angels , which would also feature one of Grauman's theatrical prologues before the film. Grauman remained as the theater's managing director for the entire run of Hell's Angels , retiring once again after its run finished. Unsatisfied with retirement, though, Grauman returned to the theater as managing director on Christmas Day 1931 and kept that position until his death in 1950. Continued success The Chinese Theatre hosted the 1944, 1945, and 1946 Academy Awards ceremonies; they are now held at the adjacent Dolby Theatre , formerly known as the Kodak Theatre. One of the highlights of the Chinese Theatre has always been its grandeur and d\u00e9cor.

Tartaglia performed his first ceremony as what the City of Los Angeles termed \"Hollywood's Master Mason\" for Jean Simmons in 1953, for the premiere of The Robe , the first premiere in CinemaScope . Although replacing Klossner was initially thought to be a temporary job for Tartaglia, his dedication resulted in a 35-year career in which he last performed as the master mason/concrete artist in honor of Eddie Murphy in May 1987. Tartaglia was formally recognized by the City of Los Angeles in October 2011. Preservation and modernization The theater in 1964 The Chinese Theatre was declared a historic and cultural landmark in 1968, and has undergone restoration projects in the years since then. Ted Mann , owner of the Mann Theatres chain and husband of actress Rhonda Fleming , purchased it in 1973. From then until 2001, it was known as Mann's Chinese Theatre. Mann Theatres grew to become the largest independent chain in the country before Mann sold the business, including the Chinese Theatre, to Gulf+Western in 1986. In 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places , with the Chinese Theater listed as a contributing property in the district. In 1988, Warner Bros. Discovery's predecessor, Warner Communications Inc., bought a 50% stake from Gulf+Western for $150 million. The theater chain was eventually sold to WestStar Holdings in 1997.

In 2000, Behr Browers Architects, a firm previously engaged by Mann Theatres, prepared a restoration and modernization program for the structure. The program included a seismic upgrade, new state-of-the-art immersive sound and projection, new vending kiosks, and exterior signage, and the addition of a larger concession area under the balcony. The program began in 2002 and restored the original name \u2014 \"Grauman's Chinese Theatre\" \u2014 to the cinema palace. As part of the upgrade, Behr Browers also designed a new Chinese-themed six-plex in the attached Hollywood and Highland shopping center that continued to operate under the name Mann's Chinese 6 Theatre. In 2007, the CIM Group purchased the land on which the theater sits for an undisclosed price from the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation of New York and Barlow Respiratory Hospital of Los Angeles. CIM Group also owns the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, as well as numerous other residential and commercial properties in Hollywood. On May 27, 2011, Chinese Theatres LLC, a collaboration owned by producer Elie Samaha and Donald Kushner , purchased both Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the adjacent Mann Chinese 6. Grauman's Chinese Theatre was sold for $25 million in 2013, and today it continues to serve the public as a first-run movie theater. Architecture Exterior The theater's front doors Raymond M.

Prior to conceiving the Exotic Revival -style plan for the Chinese Theatre, Meyer & Holler had previously designed the similarly themed West Coast Theatre in Long Beach . Plans called for an ambitious venue that would cost US$2.1 million to construct, considered a very high budget for a movie theater at the time. The exterior's most notable feature is the 90 foot (27 m)-tall pagoda centered in the middle of the forecourt. The pagoda's upright structure is supported by two prominent red pillars and its roof is plated in bronze. The design features numerous traditional Chinese ornamentations, including a 30 foot (9.1 m)-tall stone-carved mural of a dragon on the central wall between the columns. Two Ming dynasty -era guardian lion statues flank the venue's entrance. The U.S. government granted permission for the statues, as well as temple bells and other artifacts, to be imported from China. Moon Quon, a Chinese poet and filmmaker, traveled to the United States to oversee a team of Chinese artisans tasked with creating the theater's traditional decoration. Xavier Cugat painted the trees and foliage between the pillars on the side walls and Keye Luke painted the Chinese murals in the lobby. Interior The auditorium features a sixty-foot-wide ornate doily on its ceiling with various silver dragon emblems and gold medallions. A bronze chandelier fashioned to appear as a lantern hangs from the center of the doily. The theater's color scheme is primarily various shades of red \u2013 ruby, crimson, pale scarlet, and coral lacquer \u2013 with bronze, gold, stone, and silver providing accents.

In its original configuration, the auditorium included a 150 foot (46 m)-wide, 46 foot (14 m)-deep, 71 foot (22 m)-high stage, one of the largest in the world. The stage was divided into sections, making it possible to recess it into a 20 foot (6.1 m)-deep pit below in order to quickly change sets during live productions. The theater used \"its own power plant\" and an \"auxiliary dynamo system\" to generate its electricity independent of the city power grid . Despite the grandiose nature and high construction cost of the theater, its original capacity of 2,258 was only about half of the seats that the largest movie palaces had at the time. The lack of a proper general-admission balcony partly contributed to its smaller size; instead, the auditorium features four private box suites . The Chinese Theatre was the first commercial movie theater to have air conditioning. The vents are concealed behind the imported decorative pillars on the side walls of the auditorium. The interior design also features a concealed three-manual, 17-rank Wurlitzer organ; its pipes were above the proscenium with tone chutes directing the sound through holes in the ceiling to make the sounds \"feel like they were descending from the heavens.\" In 1957, theater ownership removed the organ and gave it to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles , who in turn installed most of its parts at the St. Finbar Church in Burbank .

The new 94 ft \u00d7 46 ft (29 m \u00d7 14 m) silver screen is curved and can be masked for premieres and screening events of non-IMAX films. To accommodate better sightlines and a taller screen, seating was re-arranged in stepped rows, descending from street level to the floor of the former basement. The auditorium's decorative walls and ceiling remain unaltered, the existing curtain was extended, decorative lighting effects were added and TCL added digital signage. The theater reopened on September 20, 2013, with the IMAX 3D version of The Wizard of Oz . Although it opened with only a digital projection system, a 70 mm IMAX projection system was installed for the runs of Interstellar and Oppenheimer in 2014 and 2023 respectively. Because of the success of the Oppenheimer run, the 70 mm projection system was kept in 2024 for the re-release of Tenet and the release of Dune: Part Two .

The station's studios are located on Broadcast Plaza just west of downtown, and its transmitter is located on Sandia Crest , east of Albuquerque. KOB was Albuquerque's and New Mexico's first television station, beginning broadcasting on November 29, 1948. It was set up by Albuquerque radio station KOB (770 AM) , which remained co-owned with it until 1986. It held affiliations with all four television networks of the period until 1953, when two other TV stations started in the city. KOB was sold twice in its first decade of operation, in 1952 to Time Inc. and former Federal Communications Commission chairman Wayne Coy and again in 1957 to what today is Hubbard Broadcasting. Its newscasts led the ratings until the mid-1970s, when KOAT-TV surpassed it for first. Despite attempts to compete, KOB's news has mostly remained in second place over its history. History Television-related activity by Albuquerque radio station KOB (770 AM) predated World War II . In December 1943, KOB applied for a permit for an experimental television station. Seven months later, in July 1944, KOB applied for television channel 1 on a fully commercial basis. Having already ordered equipment, KOB stated it was in position to bring television to Albuquerque once wartime prohibitions on equipment production were lifted. The permit was granted on May 21, 1946, and the application was adjusted later that year to specify channel 4. KOB reiterated its desire to provide television service when the equipment became available.

In May 1948, KOB announced that KOB-TV would begin broadcasting in August. By that time, the station had taken delivery of the second commercial TV transmitter built by RCA . KOB-TV started operations on November 29, 1948, to an audience of an estimated 100 television receivers. It was the first television station in New Mexico. Programs from NBC and the DuMont Television Network were shipped to Albuquerque on film for airing. Affiliations with CBS and ABC were added in January and July 1949, respectively. The station broadcast a variety of local events, such as a Border Conference track and field meet and University of New Mexico and high school football games. KOB radio and television, owned by an affiliate of the Albuquerque Journal newspaper, were sold in 1952 to magazine publisher Time Inc. and former FCC chairman Wayne Coy . It was Time's first investment in television. That same year, the FCC lifted a freeze, lasting three and a half years, on new television station allocations. Two additional VHF channels, 7 and 13, were assigned to Albuquerque. KOB entered into a joint venture with one of the new stations, KGGM-TV (channel 13), in May 1953 to develop Sandia Crest as a television transmitter site. The facility promised to provide television to previously unserved areas of New Mexico. KGGM-TV, a CBS affiliate, and KOAT-TV (channel 7), an ABC affiliate, debuted days apart in October 1953.

The stations purchased an entire city block at Fourteenth Street and Coal Avenue SW, divided it, and put up studios across the street from each other. The KOB building, which the station occupied in April 1954, was two stories tall and contained two studios. The end of the freeze also brought live network broadcasting to Albuquerque. By 1952, KOB-TV was the only television station in the United States not directly interconnected with a network. Albuquerque was connected to live network programming in September 1954. Hubbard ownership In 1956, Time Inc. acquired three television stations from Consolidated Television and Radio Broadcasters of Indianapolis . Time already owned three TV stations including KOB-TV, and at six stations, it surpassed the FCC ownership limit of five. It decided to sell the KOB stations.

Between 1974 and 1976, on the advice of broadcast consultant Frank Magid and his firm, anchor Johnny Morris quit (later to work at KOAT); weathercaster George Fischbeck quit; and sportscaster Mike Roberts was fired. Channel 7 surged ahead in early 1976, pushing KOB to second. KOB spent much of the late 1970s seeking to fight back against KOAT, led by top-rated anchorman Dick Knipfing , whom KOB attempted to lure away in 1976. In April 1979, Knipfing announced he would move to KOB, even though he had a contract with KOAT that ran through August 1980. Station management and Magid believed Knipfing's success at KOAT was the main obstacle to improving ratings for KOB's newscasts and predicted they would soon rise to first place. Even though KOAT fired Knipfing in June 1979, it sued to keep Knipfing off the air until his contract with that station lapsed; an opinion from the United States District Court allowed him to proceed with his plans to begin anchoring at channel 4 on August 1. The Knipfing hiring was not the success station management hoped it would be. Ed Otte, city editor for The Santa Fe New Mexican , noted that KOB had added Knipfing to its newscast without improving its other on-air personalities or reporting team, which he felt were inferior to KOAT's.

In 1983, the station switched its newscasts to a co-anchor format. In March 1986, the station dismissed Knipfing. A common complaint of KOB's newscasts in the 1970s and 1980s was the reliance on Magid to determine by research the station's newscast format and elements. Magid and the Hubbard family were close personal friends. Johnny Morris, a former KOB weathercaster who\u2014after being dismissed from channel 4 in 1974, reportedly at Magid's suggestion\u2014later worked at KOAT. Other local news employees believed Magid had a poor grasp of the Albuquerque market. Months after being ousted, Knipfing wrote an editorial in The Albuquerque Tribune heavily critical of KOB. He wrote, \"The problem was Magid ... It was very difficult assembling a consistent news team with consultants looking over our shoulders all the time.\" He noted inconsistency and turnover in everything from production to management and sports talent. Former KOB news director Mark Slimp blamed Magid for his dismissal. In the 1980s and 1990s, KOB expanded its newscast offerings beyond two evening newscasts.

In 2019 it was acquired by Canadian software company OpenText . It backs up documents, e-mails, music, photos, and settings. It is named after carbonite , the fictional substance used to freeze Han Solo in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back . Carbonite was the first such service to offer unlimited backup space for a fixed price. Previously, all online backup services were priced by the gigabyte . Carbonite offers two separate lines of products: Carbonite Home and Home Office for individuals, families, and one- or two-person businesses; and Carbonite Small Business for businesses with three or more computers. At one time in its history, Carbonite was named \"Best Windows Backup Tool\" by Lifehacker , \"Labs Winner\" by PC Pro , and \"Editor's Choice\" by NextAdvisor, but received only \"two mice\" in a MacWorld review putting it second to last. Product details Carbonite Online Backup installs a client software program on the user\u2019s computer that operates continuously in the background . This client software automatically seeks out new and changed files on the user\u2019s computer and backs them up using incremental backup . Each file is compressed and encrypted using a 128-bit Blowfish encryption before it is sent to remote servers at the company's data centers via the Internet . (This of course requires that the user's computer be continually connected to the internet, and the speed of the internet connection will impact system performance.) Data is transmitted to the servers using a secure SSL link. The encrypted files are stored on 15-drive RAID 6 storage arrays.

The terms allow Carbonite to release information to law enforcement upon demand or if Carbonite suspects illegal use. This would help law enforcement if Carbonite can give them the encryption key , which they can for all Mac and most Windows users. Windows users can manage their own key by selecting \"Advanced\" during installation. Users cannot make the key private later if they initially let Carbonite manage it. If Carbonite manages the key, users can download files to any computer. If the user manages the key, user can only access files from the backed up computer ( File Explorer/This PC/Carbonite Drive ), and if that computer is inaccessible, the user must upload and let Carbonite manage the key before accessing the backed up files from another computer. The Terms let Carbonite delete files with or without notice, but normally they keep the three most recent versions, and one version per day for the past week, one per week for 3 weeks before that, and 1 per month for 2 and 3 months ago. They also delete files which were deleted by the user more than 30 days before, or when payment ends. Carbonite offers telephone support to recover from ransomware viruses. Terms also disclaim any warranties and damages, require arbitration in Boston , and disallow class action suits . Terms require users to pay ( indemnify ) Carbonite's losses if they relate to improper actions by the user.

Additionally, the New York Times reported that the CEO was made aware of the situation in September 2008 but did nothing to remove the false postings until the NY Times blog appeared in January 2009. Misleading advertising controversy The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom ruled on August 1, 2012, that Carbonite had misled consumers by describing its online backup as unlimited. Following a complaint, the ASA investigated and found that due to bandwidth restrictions for uploading data, which limit upload to 2 Mbit/s for the first 200 GB but then to only 100 kbit/s once 200 GB had been exceeded, the backup was not unlimited. Therefore, the advert was \"likely to mislead consumers\". Additionally, Carbonite breached rule 1.7 of the CAP Code for failing to respond to the ASA's charges. In 2014, Carbonite stated that they have eliminated bandwidth throttling for all of their customers.

These criteria are rooted in the \"five freedoms\" that are used to evaluate animal welfare in the UK. The certification is not granted to farmers who use growth hormones. The standards are regularly reviewed by a scientific advisory committee. Program results In 2014, the American Humane Association announced that it had certified one billion animals on more than 8,000 farms. 90 percent of cage-free eggs sold in the US have been certified by the American Humane Association. In 2014, turkey producer Butterball became an American Humane Certified producer. Other producers include The Happy Egg Company , Foster Farms, and Clover Organic Farms. Consumer support for humanely raised food has increased since the start of the program.

While Consumer Reports rates American Humane Certified as \u201cGood,\u201d it notes that there are several important drawbacks and limitations to this certification. One major issue is the farms do not have to allow animals to express normal behaviors; some animals may be crated or caged (and Consumer Reports therefore lists swine and laying hen standards as \u201cfair\u201d), and animals cannot graze. Another limitation is the farm does not have to meet all the standards to get certified: \u201cA farm can be certified if it meets 85 percent of the criteria at the time of inspection, but the consumer has no way of knowing which criteria were met and which were not\u201d. Furthermore, farms are allowed to physically alter the animals without providing pain relief. According to animal welfare group Farm Forward , American Humane Certified is a certification closely tied with the farming industry it claims to oversee and is used as a marketing tool. Because AHC relies on fees generated from its certifications to maintain its operations, there is a strong disincentive for AHC to set animal welfare standards higher than what its biggest customers have already adopted, lest it risk losing revenue. As a result, Farm Forward asserts that AHC is structurally disincentivized to improve animal welfare for the producers it certifies. Criticism In June 2015, Mercy for Animals released a video of an undercover investigation of American Humane Certified factory, operated by Foster Farms. The footage included workers treating the chickens violently and inhumane slaughter methods; this resulted in Mercy for Animals calling the program \"a scam\". According to Consumer Reports, \"while the American Humane Association says its standards aim to ensure the humane treatment and improve the welfare of farm animals, the requirements fall short in meeting consumer expectations for a \u201chumane\u201d label in many ways.

Most Americans think that a \u201chumane\u201d label should mean that the animals had adequate living space (86%), went outdoors (78%) and were raised without cages (66%). The American Humane Certified standards do not always assure consumers that these basic requirements were met. For example, minimum space requirements are sometimes greater than the industry norm, but do not always allow for freedom of movement. Animals such as chickens, pigs and turkeys can be continually confined indoors; female pigs with their newborn piglets can even be confined in barren crates that do not allow the mother pig to turn around, much less engage in natural and instinctive nesting behaviors. For beef cattle and dairy cows, grazing on pasture is not required and feedlots are allowed.\" They have also been heavily criticized for certifying other corporations guilty of numerous animal cruelty cases such as Butterball.

She famously unsuccessfully sued actor Lee Marvin in 1977, having cohabited with him from 1965 to 1970. The trial, which brought about the concept of palimony , was widely covered in the media. During this time, she legally changed her name to add Marvin's surname to her own. She was represented by attorney Marvin Mitchelson . Personal life and career Triola was born in Los Angeles and majored in theater arts at UCLA . Triola was married to actor Skip Ward for six months from November 1961 to June 1962. In 1976, she began living with actor Dick Van Dyke and reportedly stayed with him until her death in 2009; however, it was revealed in December 2025 that Van Dyke's relationship with his current wife Arlene Silver, who he is acknowledged to have first met in 2006, had by then been ongoing \"for nearly 20 years.\" She had no children. Triola was a lounge singer and dancer. She danced in the original 1958 Broadway production of Flower Drum Song , directed by Gene Kelly . Her film acting career consisted of minor roles, including a stand-in in Lee Marvin's 1965 film Ship of Fools and a guest role on the Dick Van Dyke television series Diagnosis: Murder . Suing Lee Marvin Although she and Marvin never married, Triola sought financial compensation similar to that available to spouses under California's alimony and community property laws. The result was the landmark case Marvin v. Marvin , 18 Cal. 3d 660 (1976).

Marshall ordered Marvin to pay $104,000 to Triola for \"rehabilitation purposes\", but denied her community property claim for one half of the $3.6 million which Marvin had earned during their six years of cohabitation. The award was overturned in 1981 by the California Second District Court of Appeals , which ruled that the award was not proper but left intact the precedent, which permitted unmarried couples to sue for division of property when they separate. The appellate court found that there was no basis for the award. Death In April 2008, she underwent surgery for lung cancer .

Rescued by HMS Resolute , which was itself later lost to the ice, McClure returned to England in 1854, where he was knighted and rewarded for completing the passage. The expedition discovered the first known Northwest Passage, in the geographical sense, which was the Prince of Wales Strait . It also made the first passage, or journey, across the Canadian Arctic from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. It did not, however, traverse the Prince of Wales Strait. Instead, the expedition did a portage across Banks Island , crossed the Banks Strait, Melville Sound , Barrow Strait , and then entered the Atlantic Ocean via the Parry Channel . As the expedition had been beset by numerous troubles, this second route was \"discovered\" haphazardly as the crew of the expedition attempted to find their way to civilization. Today, shipping across the Northwest Passage is a rare occurrence and is not commercially viable due to the unreliability of predicting the state of sea ice in the region.

Two ships were assigned to this task. Enterprise was returned to the search under Captain Richard Collinson , and Investigator under Commander Robert J. McClure in his first Arctic command.

As the crew made their way along the coast east of Point Barrow, they left message cairns at each landing site and occasionally traded with local Inuit. However, they did not obtain any news about Franklin. Contact was made with several groups of Inuit near Point Warren near the Mackenzie River , one of which reported the death of a European. It was soon determined not to be a member of Franklin's party, but that of an overland expedition of Sir John Richardson two years earlier.

After sighting an extent of Banks Island , claiming it as \"Baring Land\", a brief land exploration was made, presumably the first. A rock formation at a prominent cape was named Nelson Head on 7 September after its imagined resemblance to Lord Nelson . The coast was followed in hopes of access to the north. Periods of good progress were made, until a wind change caused the ice to close in around Investigator on 10 September just as they had discovered a route of some promise, the Prince of Wales Strait . Their progress through the ice was deliberate and slow, aided at times by the use of ice anchors and saws. Daily temperatures were now around 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C). By 16 September, they had reached 73\u00b010'N, 117\u00b010'W, logged as her most advanced position. Just short of Barrow's Strait, the rudder was unshipped and winter preparations began. A year's worth of provisions were brought on deck in anticipation of the ship being crushed by the pack ice. The dangerously drifting pack finally ground to a halt on 23 September. At times violently shifted by the grinding pack ice, Investigator endured just south of Princess Royal Island, the pack becoming less violent by 27 September 1850. On the last day of September, the temperature fell below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) for the first time, as the top-gallant masts were taken down for the winter and the last birds were observed. Periods of calm were often punctuated by violent ice movement.

Several explorations across the ice to land were made, and observations left McClure with no doubt as to the existence of a Northwest Passage. In mid-October, formal possession of Prince Albert's Land and several nearby islands was taken. The crew began the routines that would characterise their Winter Quarters, which included lessons in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Hunting opportunities were sparse, although five musk oxen were taken around this time, extending rations (some lost to spoilage) with fresh meat. The Northwest Passage On 21 October 1850, Captain McClure embarked on a seven-man sledge trip north-east to confirm his observations of a Northwest Passage. McClure provided that confirmation upon his return on 31 October, having seen an unblocked strait to the distant Melville Island from a 600-foot peak (180 m) on Banks Island.

Below deck air quality was maintained by increased ventilation and regular airing out of the quarters. The new year was welcomed in as the crew amused themselves, occasionally catching foxes or spotting seals. Winter temperatures averaged \u221237 \u00b0F (\u221238 \u00b0C), and on 3 February, the sun returned after 83 days of darkness. An emergency depot of provisions and a whaleboat were made on the nearby island. Reindeer, Arctic fox, hare, raven, wolf and a polar bear were observed as local expeditions resumed. As spring returned, the decks of Investigator were cleared of snow and repairs begun. Additional local expeditions were mounted, but none with the object of attempting to meet with concurrent regional rescue expeditions; Resolute under Captain Horatio Austin , believed to be near Melville Island, Assistance under Captain Erasmus Ommanney , the Pioneer under Lieutenant John B. Cator, and Intrepid under Sherard Osborn as well as more distant ships under Captain William Penney , Admiral Sir John Ross , the First Grinnell expedition under Lieutenant Edwin De Haven and the overland Rae\u2013Richardson Arctic expedition . As the weather warmed in mid-May, additional hunting and exploration parties were sent out to supplement the dwindling provisions. Some of these parties returned with frostbitten crew members, and one had met a small group of Inuit seal hunters who lived in isolation.

The ship was finally freed on 4 July sailing amidst the grinding ice near the Princess Royal Islands. Progress northward was made, the ship often attached to larger floes, and there was even some anticipation of completing the passage in that direction. However, in August, progress slowed as the ice became increasingly solid and difficult to navigate.

It was later suggested that, if Investigator had been equipped with a screw propeller, she could have pressed the 45 miles (72 km) to Melville Island, completed the Northwest Passage, and returned home that same year. The decision to abandon the strait and proceed around the south coast of Baring Island (his name for Banks Island) led them to open water and a wider area of search. Rounding to the north east, they continued through the loose ice until conditions compelled them to secure the ship to an iceberg for protection. Explorations of the nearby coast were made, revealing abandoned Inuit camps and the unusual discovery of petrified wood from an extensive forest at 74\u00b027\u2032N.

Rather than following the pack ice east, McClure chose to take refuge in an open bay. On 23 September, the ship's progress was halted by the ice, and the crew prepared for a second winter. Some of them believed that entering the bay had been a fatal mistake. Expedition surgeon Armstrong went so far as to state that \"entering this bay was the fatal error of our voyage.\" The pack ice would have taken them within 50 miles (80 km) of Melville Island, and improved their chance of an early break-up in the spring. The location of their wintering was 74\u00b06\u2032N, 118\u00b055\u2032W, and was subsequently named Mercy Bay . Diminishing provisions, as well as the subsequent caching of food at the Princess Royal Islands left them with less than ideal stores. By October, heating was briefly curtailed until the more severe periods of winter, with temperatures below deck holding near \u221210 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C). Hunting parties were generally successful, although their exploration frustratingly revealed extents of open water that would have provided escape, only eight miles (13 km) outside of Mercy Bay. As winter pressed on, the weakening hunting parties frequently required rescue. On 10 November, the final 'housing in' of the ship commenced, largely sealing it for the winter. The crew busied themselves in the manufacture of needed items, and adopted patches of gun wadding as their currency. Tedium was severe, with two crewmen briefly going mad with boredom.

Frequent hunting of nearby reindeer continued to supplement the provisions, although the hunters suffered from the cold and occasionally required rescue. Despite the occasional fresh meat, the crew continued to gradually weaken. Of all the ships searching for Franklin the previous year, now only Enterprise and Investigator , separated, remained in the arctic. On 11 April, McClure led seven men out by sledge with 28 days of provisions to reach Melville Island across the ice, and hopefully to make contact with other British explorers in the area. In late April, the first case of scurvy was observed, with several others soon to follow. McClure's party returned on 7 May, relating that poor visibility and soft snow had hampered their progress. They did not reach Melville Island, but obtained enough of a view of the strait and large harbor to determine that Captain Austin's forces were not present. They did find the cairn left by Sir Edward Parry during his 1819\u20131820 expedition, which also contained a June 1851 communication from Captain Austin. This did not include the information that traces of Franklin's expedition had been found the previous year at Beechey Island . June found the crews preparing for their expected liberation from the ice of Mercy Bay, and although temperatures rose, it was cooler than the previous year. Cases of scurvy continued to increase, although hunting and gathering of the emerging sorrel provided improvement.

By September, all hopes of freeing the ship had evaporated, and McClure planned for the possibility of abandoning the ship in the spring, writing that \"nothing but the most urgent necessity will induce me to take such a step.\" The third winter On 8 September, McClure announced his plan for springtime escape, in which 26 of the crew would make for Cape Spencer (550 miles away), where Austin had left a cache and a boat, and from there, to seek rescue on Baffin Bay . A smaller party of 8 men would proceed back along the shore of Banks Land, to the cache and boat set by McClure in 1851, then making for the Hudson's Bay Company's post on the Mackenzie River for rescue. This would stretch the provisions for the crews remaining on board Investigator . To this end, food rations were immediately reduced, and hunting success became ever more critical, which now included mice. As October progressed, the crew's health continued to deteriorate as they braced themselves for the coldest winter yet. The crew readied the ship for winter as freezing temperatures extended below deck. Full darkness returned on 7 November. Morale and physical activity, including hunting, waned. The officers continued hunting, often requiring rescue as temperatures reached \u221265 \u00b0F (\u221254 \u00b0C). 1852 ended with the crew weaker and more afflicted than ever before, although not a single member of the crew had been lost. 1853 brought the coldest conditions yet, once reaching \u221267 \u00b0F (\u221255 \u00b0C).

On 3 March, the crew selections were announced, and those who were to remain behind were disappointed by the news. Full rations were restored to those men preparing to set out in mid-April, and their health improved. Still, on 5 April, the first crew member, John Boyle, succumbed to illness, which impacted morale and underscored the dire nature of their situation. Relief and the fourth winter Preparations for the escape parties continued, despite their slim chances for success. On 6 April, a detail of men digging Boyle's grave observed a figure approaching from seaward. It was Lieutenant Bedford Pim of HMS Resolute , which was wintering off Melville Island under Captain Henry Kellett 28 days away by sledge. Resolute was accompanied by Intrepid , laying supply depots off Melville Island for the continued search of Franklin and now McClure (having located one of McClure's stashed messages from 1852). Afterwards, Pim described meeting McClure: \"Who are you, and where (did) you come from?\" \"Lieutenant Pim, Herald, Capt. Kellett.\" This was more inexplicable to M'Clure, as I was the last person he shook hands with in Behring's Straits.

Some exercise was possible for the crew, breathing aided by the modern Jeffreys respirator . On 15 April, the 28-man traveling party, now concentrated on Melville Island alone, set out on three sledges. Four days later, McClure reached the ships and met with Captain Kellett and Commander McClintock . McClure returned on 19 May, with the expedition surgeon of Resolute , Dr. W. T. Domville. A medical survey was made to determine whether Investigator could be adequately manned if freed from the ice. The assessment fell short of the requirements, \"utterly unfit to undergo the rigour of another winter in this climate,\" making the abandonment of Investigator inevitable, ordered by Captain Kellett of Resolute . The official announcement was made, and all men were put back on full rations for the first time in 20 months. A beach supply depot was established by the end of May, accompanied by a cairn and a monument to the fallen crew members. On 3 June, final flags were raised and the remaining crew abandoned Investigator , travelling by sledge to Resolute , with 18 days of provisions and McClure leading the way on foot.

The weakened crew made Melville Island on 12 June and reached the ships on 17 June. Hunting supplemented the provisions while Resolute and Intrepid waited for their own release from the ice. The breakup came on 18 August and the ships followed the edge of the pack ice before becoming fixed in the ice in early November at 70\u00b041' N, 101\u00b022' W. The combined crews prepared for another winter in the ice, while another crewman died on 16 October. Far from shore, no effective hunting could be resumed. In October 1853, a group of sick crew members were evacuated from Resolute and North Star and returned to England, bringing the first news of Investigator and the Northwest Passage to the public. 1854 marked the beginning of the fifth year in the Arctic for the crew of Investigator . Escape and return Plans were made to detach the crew of Investigator to North Star at Beechey Island in the spring of 1854. These three sledge parties set out on 10\u201312 April. The journey was severe, but the crews were in improved condition. Socks routinely froze to feet and had to be cut off to fight frostbite . Despite these unfavourable circumstances, North Star was reached on 23\u201327 April by the parties. Even with this relief, another man succumbed at Beechey Island. They occupied themselves searching the surrounding area for additional traces of Franklin, as Beechey Island was now known to be his first winter quarters. Meanwhile, Resolute and Intrepid were themselves abandoned, with their crews joining the Beechey Island camp on 28 May.

They proceeded along Greenland and reached the English port of Ramsgate on 6 October 1854, having been gone four years and ten months and losing five men. Aftermath and controversy Upon return to England, McClure was immediately court martialled and pardoned for the loss of the Investigator , according to custom. He was awarded a share of the \u00a310,000 prize for completing a Northwest Passage, knighted and decorated. He never made another Arctic voyage. Despite this overall success, several points of controversy were raised: When the ambitious McClure severed contact with their consort ship Enterprise before reaching Arctic waters, he essentially initiated a solo voyage. Described alternately as a combination of faulty communications or outright deception, this decision increased the risk to the expedition by eliminating the benefits of cooperation. The voyage's September 1851 progress was stalled by McClure's decision not to push more aggressively towards open water. Much effort was made with little advancement after that, which was considered by expedition surgeon Armstrong to be a critical failure contributing to their subsequent problems. Armstrong also considered the entry into Mercy Bay (which became their second winter quarters and final position) rather than following the coastal ice floes to be a major mistake. It eliminated any possible future opportunities to press towards Melville Island through the pack ice. Failing to attempt a meeting with Captain Austin on Melville Island in April 1851 may also have contributed to the hardships endured.

It has also been suggested that the plan was simply a ploy to eliminate the weakest two-thirds of the crew to extend the rations for McClure and his chosen few aboard the Investigator . Ship located In July 2010, Parks Canada archeologists looking for HMS Investigator found it fifteen minutes after they started a sonar scan of Banks Island , Mercy Bay , Northwest Territories . The archaeology crew reported no plans to raise the ship, but planned a thorough sonar scan of the area and dispatch of a remotely operated vehicle . Parks Canada archeologists scheduled dives on the Investigator site for 15 days beginning on 10 July 2011 to gather detailed photographic documentation of the wreck. Led by Marc-Andre Bernier, the team of six divers were the first to visit the wreck, which lies partially buried in silt just 150 metres (490 ft) off the north shore of Banks Island.

Her mother was Chirsty MacLean, and her father was the local blacksmith, Malcolm MacAskill. She attended Portree High School and graduated from Glasgow University . Career Watt worked as a school teacher, teaching English in Tarbert , Harris , and Portree before marrying Robert Watt and relocating to his native Dunfermline . Upon her marriage, she was required to retire from teaching, but was brought back into service as a teacher during the Second World War , rising to the position of Deputy Head of Moss-side Secondary School in Cowdenbeath . She became a campaigner for equality with both the EIS and the newly formed Commonwealth Party. Literary contributions Eilidh Watt was a prolific writer of Scottish Gaelic short stories and a regular contributor to the quarterly magazine Gairm ; she pioneered child-oriented stories as well. A number of her short stories were also collected and published as books. Moray Watson writes that the \"quality of Watt's stories is variable, but there is no doubt that much of her best writing appears in Gairm rather than in her published books.\" Some of her Gaelic-language stories have science fiction themes, including extrasensory perception (which she described as something she personally experienced), postapocalyptic settings and interplanetary societies.

Determined to find Fanny, Ferdie and Angie set out on a journey, joined by Savio Da Gama (a friend of both Angie and Gabo), Gabo\u2019s mother Rosie, and the unsavory artist Don Pedro Cleto Collaco.

When they run out of petrol, Ferdie volunteers to go and get some in the morning, so the group spends the night in the open field next to the road. Don Pedro tries to seduce Rosie into being a model for his painting, whilst Savio and Angie go away from the others to talk. Savio tells Angie that he does not have a big business in Mumbai as presumed, but rather, he was a waiter for 5 years and is not wealthy. It is revealed that Angie only married Gabo because Savio never asked her, and she was in love with Savio as he was with her. He kisses her, and she slaps him.

She gets extremely upset and begins to yell at Savio, telling him that he should have died instead of Gabo and that Gabo only married Angie because Savio was in love with her. Savio angrily tells Rosie that she is selfish and reveals that her cat is actually dead, but she hadn't even noticed, leaving everyone else to look after it. They bury the cat and set off home. On the way, Rosie accidentally opens the glove compartment in the car and finds Savio's father's revolver. She puts it to her head, intending to shoot herself.

During this period, he also studied local Goan Catholics , and added some dysfunctional characters into what he called, \"hybrid Marquezian Indian village\", which became the fictional village of Pocolim. To get local nuances and cultural research right, he took the help of Goan writer Cecil Pinto. Adajania didn't intend to write the film as a road film; instead, he placed it in the genre of As Good as It Gets (1997). This was his second collaboration with Kersi Khambatta, who also wrote the dialogues for his debut film, Being Cyrus (2006). Khambatta wrote the scenes, chapter by chapter, like a novel, which aided in the development of the script. The screenplay of Finding Fanny was adapted from a novel by Kersi Khambatta. The 200-page novel is expected to hit shelves later in 2015. He had finished writing the script of Finding Fanny by 2009, 4 years after his first directorial venture Being Cyrus released. However, casting for the film became an issue as it was an offbeat film\u2014 Imran Khan and Sonam Kapoor were initially offered roles in the films, though they turned their respective parts down. Dinesh Vijan had suggested against making the film, advising Adajania that \"you are going to make a Hinglish film which only 10 people will see.\" Hence, Adajania postponed the film and went on to direct Cocktail instead. During the shooting of Cocktail , his narration of the story to lead actress Deepika Padukone had impressed her, and she expressed her desire to be a part of the film.

By August 2013, Naseeruddin Shah and Dimple Kapadia , who earlier featured in Being Cyrus , were signed on for the film; Pankaj Kapur joined the cast the following month. Whilst the film was earlier reported to be a short film, Padukone confirmed in an interview that this was untrue. The film will be showcased in English and Hindi versions to cater for the audience in India and abroad. Before the filming could commence, sessions and workshops were organised with the actors. A month prior to the shooting, Adajania and Naseeruddin Shah figured out where to place the latter's character emotionally and his body language, through a story arc from vulnerable, even \"borderline idiotic\" to coming into his strength later in the film. Shah decided to use a mid-range voice, instead of his natural baritone. Arjun Kapoor was convinced to use a restrained acting style, compared to his usual dramatic style, and appear in the \"effortlessness of just being\".

The process was slowed down due to the arrest of the Central Board CEO on bribery charges. The film was also rejected permission twice by the Animal Welfare Board of India , due to a scene involving a hen. On 5 September, Adajania confirmed that the CBFC has finally approved the Deepika Padukone dialogue, which was previously removed. This came after he pointed out to the CBFC chairperson that it had already been approved in the film's trailer. Marketing On 2 July 2014, the first promotional pictures were released of Arjun Kapoor as Savio Da Gama and Deepika Padukone as Angie. In the picture, Arjun Kapoor dons a pair of shades and a vest, while Deepika Padukone, who plays a Goan girl, is seen wearing an apron and holding a blood-stained butcher's knife. On 8 July 2014, the official posters for the film were released and on 10 July 2014, the official trailer was released.

He claimed that the word \"Dokeia\", which was corrupted in the Greek dialect, turned into Tokat in time. History Tokat, after remaining under the rule of the Hittites , Assyrians , Hurrians and Cimmerians , passed under the rule of Persians , Macedonians of Alexander the Great period, Capodocia Kingdom and Pontus Kingdom, which gave the name \"Comana Pontica\".

KMCIC was established in October 2005, with a focus to train undergraduate and graduate students in the Basic Sciences of the medical curriculum in preparation for the USMLE Step 1 Examinations. KMCIC functions as a distinct college of Manipal University, with its own administrative body led by Dean Poornima Baliga. It started to phase out students from its campus in Manipal and relocate them to AUA's Pre-Medical and Basic Science campus in Antigua in 2011. As of 2015, no students are currently enrolled at KMCIC's Manipal campus. AUA has since then dissolved that campus after receiving California site selection approval among other states as AUA site is highly favorable among many states for placement of students. Manipal campus in its entirety is left with only secretarial and administrative staff on hand in Manipal serving to provide former students transcripts and paperwork where needed. Recognition Coursework done at KMCIC is not recognized for licensure in California and the many US states that follow the California model.

These included Medical Students Aiding in India's Development (MSAID) and Student Council. There were cultural performances spread throughout the year performed by other colleges, which KMCIC students would watch, or even participate in. The most famous of these was the annual Utsav celebration which is still held by other Manipal institutions today. Most student culture involved sports such as cricket, soccer, basketball, or visits to local sights such as End Point, Udupi and Mangalore.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed as ~70 nucleotide precursors and subsequently processed by the RNase-III type enzyme Dicer to give a ~22 nucleotide mature product. In this case the mature sequence comes from the 5' arm of the precursor. They target and modulate protein expression by inhibiting translation and / or inducing degradation of target messenger RNAs. This new class of genes has recently been shown to play a central role in malignant transformation. miRNA are downregulated in many tumors and thus appear to function as tumor suppressor genes. The mature products miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c or miR-181d are thought to have regulatory roles at posttranscriptional level, through complementarity to target mRNAs. miR-181 has been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide number of vertebrate species such as rat , zebrafish , and pufferfish (see below) ( MIPF0000007 ). Expression It has been shown that miR-181 is preferentially expressed in the B-lymphoid cells of mouse bone marrow , but also in the retina and brain .

It is shown that transfection of miR-181a and miR-181b triggers growth inhibition, apoptosis and inhibits invasion. In addition, the expression of miR-181a was found to be inversely correlated with tumor grading while miR-181b was uniformly downregulated in gliomas with different grades of malignancy.

It is also known as a tilt indicator , tilt sensor , tilt meter , slope alert , slope gauge , gradient meter , gradiometer , level gauge , level meter , declinometer , and pitch & roll indicator . Clinometers measure both inclines and declines using three different units of measure: degrees , percentage points , and topos. The astrolabe is an example of an inclinometer that was used for celestial navigation and location of astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance . A tilt sensor can measure the tilting in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes. In contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earth's ground plane, is to use an accelerometer . Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers. In aircraft, the \"ball\" in turn coordinators or turn and bank indicators is sometimes referred to as an inclinometer.

The glass face of the disc is surrounded by a graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid stands, with reference to the flat base. The zero line is parallel to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is horizontal; the 90 degree is perpendicular to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or plumb.

Al-Biruni , a Persian polymath, once wanted to measure the height of the sun. He lacked the necessary equipment to measure this height. He was forced to create a calibrated arc on the back of a counting board, which he then used as a makeshift quadrant with the help of a plumb line. He determined the location's latitude using the measurements taken with this rudimentary tool. This quadrant was most likely an inclinometer based on the quarter-circle panel. The Abney level is a handheld surveying instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its crosshair ) with the reflection of the bubble in the spirit level of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer.

Major artillery guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances. Permanently-installed tiltmeters are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure. Factors which influence the use of inclinometers (Overall accuracy varies depending on the type of tilt sensor (or inclinometer) and technology used) Gravity Temperature (drift), zero offset, linearity, vibration, shock, cross-axis sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration. A clear line of sight between the user and the measured point is needed. A well defined object is required to obtain the maximum precision. The angle measurement precision and accuracy is limited to slightly better than one arcsec. Accuracy Certain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001\u00b0; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.001\u00b0. An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis , repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity\u2014electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from \u00b10.01\u20132\u00b0 depending on the sensor and situation.

They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt. Important specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, orthogonal . The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. Common implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, liquid capacitive , electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum. Tilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. Yoshi's Universal Gravitation and Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The PlayStation 3 and Wii game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games. Inclinometers are also used in civil engineering , for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon. Some inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on CAN (Controller Area Network) . In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized CANopen profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable. Two-axis digital inclinometer Two-axis digital inclinometer Traditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range.

However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with MEMS tilt sensors provides simultaneous two-dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum. Typical advantages of using two-axis MEMS inclinometers over conventional single-axis \"bubble\" or mechanical leveling instruments may include: Simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional (X-Y plane) tilt angles (i.e. pitch & roll), can eliminate tedious swapping back-and-forth experienced when using a single-axis level, for example to adjust machine footings to attain a precise leveling position. Digital compensation and precise calibration for non-linearity, for example for operating temperature variation, resulting in higher accuracy over a wider measurement range. The accelerometer sensors may generate numerical data in the form of vibration profiles to enable a machine installer to track and assess alignment quality in real-time and verify a structure's positional stability by comparing leveling profiles before and after it is set up. Inclinometer with gyroscope As inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the abovementioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations.

Background By March 1991, tensions between Croats and Serbs escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . Following a referendum on independence that was largely boycotted by Croatian Serbs, the Croatian parliament officially adopted independence on 25 June. The Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) declared its intention to secede from Croatia and join the Republic of Serbia while the Government of the Republic of Croatia declared it a rebellion. Between August 1991 and February 1992, the RSK initiated an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive out the Croat and non-Serb population from RSK-held territory, eventually expelling as many as 250,000 people according to Human Rights Watch . Croatian forces also engaged in ethnic cleansing against Serbs in Eastern and Western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina on a more limited scale. On 4 August 1995, the Croatian Army (HV) launched Operation Storm to retake the Krajina region which was completed successfully by 7 August. The Operation resulted in the exodus of approximately 200,000 Serbs from Krajina while those Serbs who were unable or unwilling to leave their homes, primarily the elderly, were subjected to various crimes. The ICTY puts the number of Serb civilians killed at 324.

Hist\u00f3ria Background (2002\u20132010) On January 15, 2002, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Fundesul, headquartered in Teixeira de Freitas and linked to pastor Eonaldo Soares Santos, of Catedral da B\u00ean\u00e7\u00e3o , received a license to operate UHF channel 21 in the city of Porto Seguro. On February 6, 2003, the foundation was authorized to operate the station. On January 26, 2007, however, the license was suspended by the Judicial Branch in Eun\u00e1polis . The decision was taken following the request for an injunction by the Federal Public Ministry in November 2006, which argued for the suspension due to the alleged lack of a bidding process. Even with the act, in 2008, Fundesul made test broadcasts relaying TVE Bahia , and was surveyed by ANATEL in order to continue its licensing process. TV Porto Seguro (2010\u20132016) In October 2010, it was announced that UHF channel 21 would operate as TV Porto Seguro, having evangelical programming. In December 2010, broadcasts officially began, this time as a Rede Super affiliate. Despite plans to produce local programming, TV Porto Seguro continued as a full relay of Rede Super until October 2016, when it interrupted its operations again. TV Porto (2023\u2013present) On November 4, 2019, the entity obtained a new license in Porto Seguro, this time on digital UHF channel 33.

It is the most important commercial port of Italy, with a trade volume of 62 million tonnes. It is subdivided into five different Free Areas, three of which have been allotted to commercial activities. The remaining two, the Mineral Oils Free Area and the \" Canale di Zaule \" Free Area, are used for industrial activities. The port is articulated in various terminals, managed by private companies. History In the period between the beginning of 1700 and 1850, Trieste was mainly an emporium and was given the status of Free Port by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in 1719. In 1740, when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria took power, one of the first measures she adopted was to extend the borders of the Free Port area to the periphery of the town, thereby merging the emporium, the port, the new city and the old one. The Empress decided to extend the exemptions from customs duties to the whole city, which attracted many people from different countries and all walks of life ( Italians , Serbians , Slovenians , Croats , Jews and Greeks ): for them a law was passed, the \"Editto di tolleranza\", which provided for the freedom of worship, the possibility to negotiate freely and to own goods. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Trieste Company (sometimes known as the \"Austrian East India Company\") attempted to connect directly the Habsburg Empire to the Indian and Chinese markets. It appeared that it was necessary to enlarge the port infrastructure and the railway network.

In 1857 the S\u00fcdbahn (Southern) Railway line became operational along the northeastern route: Trieste , Postojna , Ljubljana , Graz , Vienna , with further links to Budapest and the Balkans . The railway element was central in the design of the port structures. In Trieste it was the Lagerh\u00e4user system of Northern European ports that was used as a model. A French engineer, Paulin Talabot , designed the project. 1868 marks the beginning of Trieste as a commercial port whose infrastructures were to be developed in four different periods. To tackle the competition of Northern ports, which had been able to attract trade because of the lack of railway connections with Trieste, and to adjust to the needs of non-European maritime transport, which was to increase after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 - with the consequent shortening of the distance separating Trieste from Bombay by 7,500 miles - in 1868 the construction of the current Porto Vecchio (the Old Port, at the time called Porto Nuovo, the New Port) was started. The Northern part of the port was built between 1868 and 1883 together with the outer breakwater and other sea infrastructure. On December 22, 1871, the new monthly service linking Trieste with Bombay was established. In 1874 a contract was signed with the S\u00fcdbahn for the development of the port and in 1879 the Magazzini Generali (the warehouses) were erected. In the same year the Pontebbana railway line was officially opened connecting Trieste , Udine , Pontebba , Villach , Salzburg and Munich .

In 1891 the port became a free port and was separated from the rest of the town by an enclosure. The status of free port, which had been previously extended to the whole city, was now being limited to this area, while the city became physically separated from it. In the period between 1901 and 1914 the works began to enlarge the river area (the embankment), to build the Bersaglieri Wharf, the Scalo Legnami (the timber pier) and S. Andrea port (piers V and VI). The fourth period, between 1924 and 1936, is characterised by the realisation of major public works, which were to complete the sea infrastructures, the port equipment on piers V and VI, the Silo, the Stazione Marittima (the passenger station), and the Idroscalo (the air harbour). After reconstructing the buildings damaged by the bombings of the Second World War , an innovative port reorganisation was started in line with the needs of the containerisation and the new transport systems. The Free Port Under free port regulations goods reaching the port by land from Italy or the EU are considered definitively exported, and goods of foreign origin arriving by land are considered foreign goods in transit. Goods arriving from abroad by sea may transit freely and be sent to their foreign destinations. By virtue of exclusive regulations on customs credits, customs duties on goods destined for import may be paid after 6 months at reduced annual interest rates. The port's special extra-customs status also allows commercial operations to be carried out on goods deposited under the foreign regimen. Repackaging, labelling, industrial processing etc. are also possible under the same terms.

The status of the Free Port Zones has remained a distinctive feature of the Port of Trieste throughout its history. Granted in 1719 by the Habsburg monarchy and restricted in 1891, this special status has been confirmed by subsequent peace treaties, by the European Community and by the Italian Parliament . Most port land is subject to this rule and therefore lies outside the jurisdiction of European Union Customs. Five Free Port Zones are defined as follows: Old Free Zone New Free Zone Timber Terminal Free Zone Mineral Oil Free Zone Industrial Free Zone The Old Free Port , the most ancient complex of facilities, was designed by Paul Talabot and built between 1868 and 1883 according to a port and railway development plan aimed at consolidating the role of Trieste as a trading centre for all territories under Austro-Hungarian rule. A modern multipurpose terminal, the Adria Terminal , has recently been created alongside the older installations. The New Free Port is the result of a project begun in the early 20th century in response to the growth of trade with the Middle East and Far East created by the opening of the Suez Canal . Completed to a large extent in the 1920s and 1930s, it has been further extended since the 1960s with the development of a container terminal at Pier 7 and a ro-ro / ferry terminal at Riva Traiana. The remaining Free Zones include - in addition to the timber and oil terminals - part of the Zaule industrial canal, which serves the (EZIT) Industrial District, established after the Second World War .

The hydrodynamic plant The hydrodynamic plant, built in 1890, is an important piece of industrial archaeology. Together with Hamburg , Buenos Aires , Calcutta and Genoa , Trieste was one of the first ports in the world to be equipped with a hydrodynamic plant. The building is located behind the pier and is characterised by a high brick smokestack and two square towers at the sides of the main facade. The plant, which ceased to be used in 1983, took the water from the water system and supplied energy to the different points of consumption. It was, therefore, a centralised energy generator, which operated the quay cranes, the external cranes and the internal hoists of the port warehouses. A series of two-flue Lancashire boilers with a 2.10m diameter and a 10m length, built by St. Jashka & Sohn from Vienna, produced steam with a pressure of 7 atmospheres. The steam was delivered to four main machines and an auxiliary one, all manufactured by Maschinenbau Aktien Gesellschaft vormals Breitfeld, Danek & Com. Prag-Karolinenthal. The main machines had a higher motive part and a lower operating one. The motive part \u2013 a 25 horsepower (19 kW) double expansion steam engine \u2013 had a central high-pressure cylinder with a 450 mm diameter and two lateral low-pressure cylinders of 600 mm diameter. A system of crankshaft rods ensured the correct timing of the three cylinders. Hydraulic pressure was kept constant by means of hydraulic accumulators .

In the years between 1920 and 1939 the plant operated 83 quay cranes, 31 external cranes for the warehouses and 57 hoists. The hydrodynamic plant - a rare example of machines that worked for more than a century - is located in a Rundbogenstil building, an architectural style that was a German version of Romanesque, very popular at the time. The Porto Vecchio The link between city and port, tied together within a single process of urban and historical development, becomes evident in the Porto Vecchio area, with an architectural heritage of great historical and artistic value. Porto Vecchio, located in the heart of the city, covers an area of about 600,000 sq.m. and represents a jewel to be relaunched through the identification of new functions. The \"capannoni\", the oldest buildings of the port, were erected after the model of the Lagerh\u00e4user, a word which refers to those parts of a city that are used for goods handling and include warehouses for the storage and stocking of goods, from their arrival in port to their shipment and distribution. The port system visually links Miramare Castle, Barcola and San Giusto Castle and follows three directions: a central one, connecting the port with the city, a second one, corresponding to the piers, and a third one, adjacent to the railway.

The buildings of the first and second groups have a perron (a raised platform, about 1 meter high, used to perform loading and unloading operations with railway cars), while those of the third group, erected in more recent years (at the beginning of 1900), show entrance doors at ground level as well. The architectural features of these monumental buildings lie in the vertical and horizontal lines along the facades, in the geometric definition of the basements, the doors, the windows and all the elements of the architectonic language of this complex. Along the facade, the horizontal lines (the stringcourses, for instance) give the buildings a longitudinal appearance, while the vertical lines (pilaster strips and avant-corpses) create interruptions. Through the harmonisation of the lines, the structural elements take up an architectural character. The main body of the facades, from the base to the superstructure, shows unity and dimensional value. At the time of the construction, decorating was achieved through the use of different finishing materials and the work of master decorators and stone-dressers.

Warehouse 26 Warehouse 26, a monumental building, covers an area of 9,000 sq.m., with a face of about 244m, an underground floor used as a cellar, a ground floor, three higher floors and a garret. It was completed in 1893. Because of the length of the building the design included two main stairs leading to the higher floors, seven elevators, eight lifts and two internal hatchways connected with the cellar. The archivolt interrupts the monotonous shape of the windows, while the design of the main facade is consistent with the other buildings. The turrets above the finishing cornices, the richly decorated mansards and the clock tower enhance the sumptuousness of this warehouse.

The reinforced-concrete building measured 45.5 m \u00d7 30 m (149 ft \u00d7 98 ft), with a height of 20.5 m (67 ft). It was of a slab-and-beam design supported by columns, the rear wall with the primary resistance to shear or torsional forces.

A volunteer force of over 6,000 mobilized to free the victims trapped in the rubble, as there was no government disaster plan in place at the time. Many people were rescued alive, including about 30 who later died from their injuries. At least 260 people were injured. The rescue effort turned to recovery and lasted over a week.

In 80% of the building, the collapsed floors were separated by debris (portions of columns and walls) leaving spaces of 3 feet (0.91 m) or less, with very limited lateral movement. As a result, many holes had to be cut through the concrete with jackhammers and oxygen-acetylene torches to reach the pockets. Philippine and US military, and civilian contractors all participated in this work. Around 3,000 rescuers, including soldiers and civilians, worked daily, all coordinated by Brigadier General Gaudencio Tobias of the Philippine Army . The nearby Cayetano Arellano High School (formerly Manila North High School) was used as a command center, canteen and rest area, medical clinic and morgue.

Its range of products manufactured and commercialized includes equipment for badminton and tennis ( rackets , shuttlecocks , balls , bags) and golf ( clubs , bags ). Yonex also produces athletic shoes and apparel including T-shirts , jackets , skirts , shorts , hoodies , leggings and hats . History The company was founded in 1946 by Minoru Yoneyama as a producer of wooden floats for fishing nets . The company was later forced out of this market because of the invention of plastic floats. This led to a commitment by Yoneyama to never again be left behind by technological advancements. In 1957, Yoneyama began to make badminton racquets for other brands. By 1961, the first Yoneyama-branded racquet was introduced, and within another two years an export company was created for the worldwide distribution. After the company began to make aluminium badminton racquets in 1969, it found that the same technology could be applied to the tennis racket which the company introduced in 1971. The company began to experiment with graphite shafts for both types of rackets and found that these would also be useful for golf clubs. In 1982 Yonex came out with the new oversized tennis racquet in the REX-series with the R-7 and R-10 racquets. At that time Martina Navratilova played with the R-7 and was very successful. One year later, the new series Rexking was developed with the R-22. Navratilova subsequently used the white RQ 180 widebody frame until the early 1990s. Yonex advertising", "source_type": "random"}

Yonex advertising banners at the 2013 badminton French Open Finding a growing market, the Yonex Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary) was established in Torrance, California , US in July 1983. In 1992 Yonex introduced the widebody badminton racket, the \"Isometric 500\", a racquet that was much less \"tear drop\"-shaped than previous ones. The more \"square\" head gave it a much larger striking surface, which provides a larger \"sweet spot\" to hit the shuttle. It led other manufacturers to follow suit in \"square-head\" or isometric designs. The parent company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1994. Yonex describes itself as the world leader in golf, tennis and badminton equipment. Yonex provides clothing for national badminton associations around the world, such as the Malaysian Badminton Association, Badminton Scotland , Badminton England , Badminton Ireland, and Badminton Wales. Yonex has also been teaming up with OCBC (Orange County Badminton Club) since 2007 to host the annual U.S. Open Grand Prix Badminton Championships. Yonex has become the dominant corporate player in badminton. Yonex sponsors the All England Open Badminton Championships and is a partner of the Badminton World Federation which organizes the World Championships .

Yonex is significant in the tennis and golf industries as well and is a major sponsor of professional athletes in all three sports. Controversies Yonex signed a contract with the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association regarding national team jersey sponsorship in 2014. However, Yonex would often send players clothing and shoes to wear a few days before major tournaments, with the shoes unfit for players, as players had blisters and bruises from playing in them. In May 2016, Yonex acted in a way that was ultra vires when criticizing the Taiwan national team players who had violated the dress code. Yonex sent official documents to the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association threatening to sue the national team head coaches if the Association did not provide a reasonable answer. During the 2016 Summer Olympics , Yonex provided unfit shoes to non-contract badminton player Tai Tzu-ying . This forced Tai to wear other shoes made by her personal sponsor brand, Victor , without any logo. This event caused a controversy as the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association was going to punish Tai based on Yonex's pressing. After the Tai incident, five other badminton players found themselves in the same situation and were punished. For example, Yonex was dissatisfied that badminton player Liao Kuan-hao used his personal sponsor racquet and as a result Yonex asked the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association to fine Liao and force him to be suspended for six months. In August 2016, the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association held a board meeting to resolve the situation. The meeting resulted in three key decisions: no punishment will be enforced on the \u201cplayer\u201d; to accept the resignation of Chairman Tsai Hung-peng for the controversy; to remove the word \u201cShoes\u201d and \u201cRacquets\u201d from the contract with Yonex.

For the 2024 Summer Olympics , Yonex launched a new Olympic official kit for Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) in 23rd of June 2024. However, it received heavy criticism and bashed by sports fans, calling the design \"ugly\", \"cheap-looking\" and questioned the decision of using off-looking Malaysia flag. In response, OCM agreed to redesign the attire to ensure it represents the nation's status and expectations. Datuk Hamidin Mohd Amin, Head of mission of OCM, explained that the confusion of the Malaysia flag is because the flag is represented by the official OCM logo. He also explained that the reason to the attire colour changes from orange to yellow is \"to evoke the relentless pursue of medals for the nation at the prestigious global sporting event.\" References External links Wikimedia Commons has media related to Yonex Co .

Pathological condition of the eye Polycoria is a pathological condition of the eye distinguished by more than one pupillary opening in the iris . It may be congenital or result from a disease affecting the iris. It results in decreased function of the iris and pupil, affecting the physical eye and visualization. In the early history of China, double pupils were seen as a sign that a child would become a great king or sage. True polycoria In cases of true polycoria, there is an extra pupil that tends to be reactive to light and medication. To be considered true polycoria, the extra pupil and the principal pupil must dilate , and contract simultaneously with triggers such as light, and administered drugs. The extraneous pupil is c. 2.5mm away from the principal pupil. In cases of true polycoria, there is an intact sphincter muscle , which contracts and dilates the pupils. In an eye without polycoria, the sphincter muscle is a part of the iris that functions to constrict and dilate the pupil. A patient with true polycoria experiences handicapped vision as well as stimulation of the retina in response to bright lights. It is said that the term \"true polycoria\" is overused, and used correctly when addressing congenital deformations of the iris. Often \"true polycoria\" is used when it in fact is a case of pseudopolycoria. Pseudopolycoria Although less rare than true polycoria, pseudopolycoria is still very uncommon. In cases of pseudopolycoria there is a \"passive constriction\" that differentiates the extra pupil from the true pupil during constriction and dilation. The extra pupil in pseudopolycoria is different than the extra pupil in true polycoria because it shows defects that are independent of the sphincter muscles.

The extra pupil in pseudopolycoria is different than the extra pupil in true polycoria because it shows defects that are independent of the sphincter muscles. Pseudopolycoria is often associated with Seckel syndrome , posterior polymorphous dystrophy , and juvenile glaucoma . Pseudopolycoria consists of splitting of the iris that are not contingent with the sphincter muscles at the root of the iris. Symptoms and signs The signs and symptoms shown in a patient diagnosed with polycoria are associated with ocular and adnexal growth abnormalities. The iris and the pupil become less effective. Signs can be present as a child; however, the patient may be diagnosed later in their life. This condition results in abnormal eye development affecting both eyes or just one. Causes There are not any known direct mechanisms involved in the development of true polycoria or pseudopolycoria. There are some proposed ideas, one being that after the sphincter muscle is fully formed and developed in the eye there is a severing of the pupillary margins leading to the distinction of the extra pupil and the principal pupil. Polycoria can also be caused any hole in one's iris to develop a sphincter muscle development. Another proposed theory about the cause of polycoria is intrauterine trauma, or postpartum iris trauma. If the development of the iris is hindered, the ectoderm of the eye (which forms the lens and corneal epithelium) may split, which could lead to pseudopolycoria. Genetics The gene that is the cause of this disorder is the PRDM5 gene. The PRDM5 gene has also been linked to Brittle Cornea syndrome, which is a tissue disorder of the eye, as well as Axenfeld syndrome . PRDM5 plays crucial roles in the molecular composition of the eye, as well as the tissue thickness. Axenfeld syndrome", "source_type": "random"}

PRDM5 plays crucial roles in the molecular composition of the eye, as well as the tissue thickness. Axenfeld syndrome occurs in the patient in a case of the mutation of the FOXC1 gene, which is a heterozygous mutation. Diagnosis Upon gross examination the patient will typically have excessively long eyelashes. The iris becomes hypoplastic , making abnormally shaped pupils with prominent crypts . The crypts are little squiggly lines that radiate out around the pupil; with this condition, thick round or oval openings can be seen. On diagnosis, signs lead to symptoms where there is more than one set of iris muscles, which controls the amount of light being brought into the eye. When the iris becomes deformed, it will disarrange the control of light coming in leading to blurred vision and finding it hard to visually focus. Polar cataracts will also be present in this condition where a round, opaque malformation of distorted lens fibers is located in the central posterior part of the lens showing deformity. Prevention There are no known preventive measures for polycoria, however genetic testing may be able to reveal genetic patterns of the disorder. Conditions such as reduced corneal thickness, are observed in people with cases of polycoria, as well as keratoconus (keratoconus is a corneal disease has the possibility of leading to astigmatism or blindness). However, there are some proposals that it is caused by a dissociation of the pupil margins, a partial coloboma which is a hole in the eye, or abnormal eye tissue composition.

Not all cases are treated for this iris abnormality, but when cases are treated the only treatment is surgical procedure and life-long ocular monitoring that is highly recommended. Considerations for surgery are surgical correction, intraocular surgery, or reapproximation, as if it was being treated for glaucoma or retinal detachment. Children under the age of 3, who do not seek surgery, have responded well with miotic drops that contained mydriatic/cycloplegic, allowing the separate eye sphincters to dilate and constrict together. This allows improved balance of uncorrected visual acuity. A 1-mm limbal incisions would be made, a spatula is inserted through the side to elevate the two pupils (avoiding contact with the lens), and the iris tissue would be cut using viscoelastic material. Finally, the limbal incisions were closed with stromal hydration, and intracameral cefuroxime is applied. Surgical technique There have been cases where there are various techniques for surgical procedures and can be performed on children and adults. One of the techniques for repair is by using a double armed polypropylene suture, where the suture is left externally on the sclera with a knot buried in the scleral flap. This technique allows posterior fixation of intraocular lens implants in the absence of capsular support. Another technique for surgery is called pupilloplasty, where the patient would be placed under retrobulbar anesthesia with the pupils being dilated with 1% tropicamide.

History Since true polycoria and pseudopolycoria are so rare, there is not much history on the disorders in the tradition of modern western medicine. According to an article published in 2002, there have only been 2 cases of true polycoria since 1966.Early Chinese history names multiple legendary figures as having double pupils, which as a result led to a belief that a child born with two double pupils was destined to be a great king or sage. Xiang Yu , Hegemon of Chu , blood brother and later arch nemesis of Liu Bang , the founding emperor of the Han dynasty , was given great esteem due to his prowess in combat and auspicious double pupil. After overthrowing the Qin dynasty together, he was named Hegemon of the loose series of kingdoms he created in its wake, while he gave Liu Bang the remote province of Han . The Civil War that followed called the Chu-Han contention , ending with a Han victory and a legendary last stand by the Hegemon. Pliny the Elder describes a mythological race of people known as Bythi\u00e6 who \"have a double pupil in one eye, and in the other the figure of a horse.\" See also Eye injury Iridodialysis Monocular diplopia Coloboma References Retrieved from \" https", "source_type": "random"}

History Formation The Answer were formed in 2000 by guitarist Paul Mahon, whose father was a jazz trumpeter and member of seminal Irish showband The Freshmen , who released three albums on CBS and toured with the likes of the Beach Boys . Aged 18, Paul knew he wanted to put together a rock band and mentioned it to bassist Micky Waters, an old school friend who had been in numerous cover bands around Belfast . James Heatley, who had played as Ash 's stand-in live drummer in 1993, was recruited to be the drummer for The Answer. Paul called him up only to find that he was about to take his finals at University, so the trio waited whilst James completed his degree in Psychology. In late June 2000, the four of them got together for their debut rehearsal. 2001 was spent writing, rehearsing, gigging locally and building up a set The Answer. By 2002, the band had attracted the attention of MCD promotions in Ireland, (the company who recently bought out the Mean Fiddler Group, alongside Clear Channel), who put them on as openers at the Witnness Festival that year. Eamonn Keyes, owner of Doghouse Studios recorded them before they were signed. Early recognition In 2005, Classic Rock magazine voted The Answer as Best New Band 2005, which brought them even more exposure. The Answer then went on to co-headline the first Nokia 'New School of Rock' Tour, with Tokyo Dragons and The Sound Explosion.

The Answer played several festivals over the summer months, as well as a support slot with Whitesnake throughout their UK tour. The band also managed to secure themselves another support slot with Paul Rodgers at the Royal Albert Hall in early October 2006. This was followed by a co-headlining tour with fellow Rockers Roadstar on a tour across the UK and Europe, with further support coming from American blues-rock band Rose Hill Drive . The band was once again touring, with dates in Australia and across Europe before eventually returning for dates in Ireland and to start work on their follow-up to Rise .

In the 1920s, driving over the hill was considered one of the rewarding local routes that the new generation of motorists could undertake. By the 1930s, the hill had a number of roadways on it as well as several working gravel pits that were WPA projects . Crawford Hill overlooks the Garden State Parkway ; on", "source_type": "random"}

If a view were to be unobstructed, Lower New York Bay can be seen as well as some of the New York skyline . During the 1940s and 1950s, the hill was used by the Jersey Shore Amateur Radio Association to compete in contests run by the American Radio Relay League involving the setting up of a field station and then contacting the most other amateur stations; the association came in first in the contests held in 1946 and again in 1958. Crawford Hill has also been known as a good location at which to find fossils. Bell Telephone Laboratories on the hill The main Bell Telephone Laboratories building on Crawford Hill, opened in 1962 Bell Telephone Laboratories first acquired property in Holmdel Township in 1929. Work on radio astronomy , such as that conducted by Karl Jansky , had been undertaken nearby in the early 1930s at the main site of what would later become the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex, as would many other developments in communications developments. By 1950, Crawford Hill was being used by Bell Telephone Laboratories for experiments and studies in microwave transmission , with an earlier horn antenna at the Crawford location receiving signals transmitted from a tower 22 miles away at the Bell Labs facility in Murray Hill, New Jersey . During 1955, a 60-foot parabolic antenna, nicknamed \"The Big Dish\", was constructed atop Crawford Hill. It was intended for use with super high frequency transmissions of telephone and television signals, as well as exploring aspects of over-the-horizon transmission. The antenna project was led by Arthur B. Crawford, John C. Schelleng, and Harald", "source_type": "random"}

The antenna project was led by Arthur B. Crawford, John C. Schelleng, and Harald T. Friis . The 60-foot antenna was prominent enough to be seen by motorists traveling on the Garden State Parkway . In 1959, construction began on the Holmdel Horn Antenna , whose purpose would be to receive radio signals bounced off a satellite by a transmitter at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Goldstone, California , while the Big Dish would continue to send signals in the other direction. This became Project Echo , which in 1960 achieved success as the first passive communications satellite experiment. The first message so sent was a taped greeting by President Dwight D. Eisenhower . Also in 1960, the 60-foot antenna at Crawford Hill was used to transmit and bounce a radio signal off the Moon that was received at Goldstone. At the same time that the mammoth Bell Labs Holmdel Complex was built, a much smaller and less elaborate two-story building was constructed on Crawford Hill to house the Project Echo-related researchers there. This was in 1962, and the new building housed some 140 people working on waveguides and masers in addition to microwave radio, antennas, and satellite communications. With Project Echo completed, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of Bell Labs used the Holmdel Horn Antenna located on Crawford Hill to take measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation . This occurred by happenstance starting in 1964, when they detected what appeared to be a steady noise interfering with their observations. The pair were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for these efforts that supported the Big Bang theory.

Herwig Kogelnik won the 2001 Marconi International Fellowship Award and IEEE Medal of Honor for his work in the development of fiber optic technology and the 2006 National Medal of Technology. Gerard J. Foschini was the 2002 recipient of the Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award for his pioneering inventions having to do with the capacity of communications systems with multiple antennas. As did Bell Laboratories itself, ownership of the annex went from AT&T Corporation to Lucent to Alcatel-Lucent to Nokia . The large Bell Labs Holmdel Complex was shut down in 2007, but the annex carried on for a while. Then in October 2019, the annex was put up for sale. In January 2021, Nokia sold the main research building along with the rest of the 43-acre property, for a sum of around $3.6 million, to a private individual. It relocated the remaining 66 Bell Labs research staff to the Murray Hill campus. The sale ended a six-decade-long presence of Bell Labs in Monmouth County, one that had helped the county prosper economically. Plans for site going forward The main building soon fell into a somewhat dilapidated state, matching much of the rest of the annex structures.

The sale triggered an extended concern over whether the Crawford Hill site, and the Holmdel Horn Antenna within it, might be at risk due to developers coming in. Indeed, the buyer of the land put forth plans to build a senior housing center. The Holmdel Planning Board voted to study the issue during 2023. Neighbors, citizen preservation groups, and astronomy fans all objected to the development proposal, eventually collecting for a petition some 8,000 signatures from around the country and internationally. Holmdel officials considered using eminent domain to acquire the land involved. Instead, in October 2023 a deal was reached between the township and the developer, wherein the Holmdel Township Committee did not acquire the entire site as many petitioners had hoped for, but did agree to pay $5.5 million for 35 acres (14 ha) of land, including that which the antenna sits on. In January 2024, the purchase of the 35 acres was closed, with plans to name it the Dr. Robert Wilson Park, although in what particular form the park would take was still to be determined. The two-story main building was part of what remained with the developer, with possible plans to develop it akin to the Bell Works use at the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex. Wilson, who in his late eighties lived a short distance from the site and still possessed working keys to the antenna, approved of the settlement.

The album was recorded in December 2011. Style The band has stated that the album is to be a more \"upbeat\" follow up to their previous album Bears, Mayors, Scraps & Bones , with vocalist Liam Cormier saying the album was lyrically far too dark for what the band wanted to do. In December 2011, Liam Cormier was asked about whether the groups sound has change much. \"I think sound-wise there's definitely more of the natural evolution of how gnarly we keep getting and how more refined everyone sounds. I'd say the majority of our fans now have seen our band live and know how gnarly and ferocious it is, so trying to compress that into a recording still is kind of difficult. Like we'd say 'I thought we did it pretty well on Bears', and then we'd re-examine it and see there's still some elements that are missing.\" The band's influences steered away from the \"traditional hardcore record\" and took a wide variety of influences from indie rock bands like Fleet Foxes . Cormier, when asked about his influences, stated: \"In a lot of ways we get really inspired by non-metal bands. For me, I find I really like looking at other things because I just don't want to make a traditional hardcore record lyrically.

Data and backbone services such as GSM, HSPA+, CDMA, LTE, broadband internet, IPTV, and wholesale are an increasing part of its business. Originally a state-owned corporation, the shareholding of PTCL was reduced to 62%, when 26% of shares and control were sold to Etisalat Telecommunications while the remaining 12% to the general public in 2006 under an intensified privatization program under Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz . However, the 62% of shares still remain under the management of government-ownership of state-owned corporations of Pakistan.

History Posts & Telegraph Department It was known as the Posts & Telegraph Department in 1949 and as Pakistan Telephone & Telegraph Department in 1962. Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) took over operations and functions from Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department under Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation Act 1991. This coincided with the Government's competitive policy, encouraging private sector participation and resulting in the award of licenses for cellular, card-operated pay-phones, paging and, lately, data communication services. Privatization Plan Pursuing a progressive policy, the Government in 1991, announced its plans to privatize PTCL, and in 1994 issued six million vouchers exchangeable into 600 million shares of the would-be PTCL in two separate placements.

Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited On 31 December 1995, the Pakistan Telecommunication (Reorganization) Act, 1996, was passed, which formally reconstituted the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation as PTCL. The act facilitated the transfer of the telecommunications business, along with its associated assets, rights, liabilities, and obligations, from the corporation to PTCL. However, certain exclusions were allocated to the National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC), Frequency Allocation Board (FAB), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), and Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust (PTET). As part of the reorganization process, the Government of Pakistan divested 26 percent of its PTCL shares through an initial public offering (IPO) at a strike price of PKR 30 and was subsequently listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) in 1996. PTCL launched its mobile and data services subsidiaries in 2001 by the name of Ufone and PakNet respectively. None of the brands made it to the top slots in the respective competitions. Lately, however, Ufone had increased its market share in the cellular sector. The PakNet brand has effectively dissolved over a period of time. Recent DSL services launched by PTCL reflects this by the introduction of a new brand name and operation of the service being directly supervised by PTCL.

The post-monopoly era came with Pakistan\u2019s Liberalization in Telecommunication in January 2003. On the Government level, a comprehensive liberalization policy for the telecoms sector is in the offering. In 2005, Government of Pakistan decided to sell 26 percent of the company to some private corporation. There were three participants in the bidding process for the privatization of PTCL. Etisalat , an Abu Dhabi company was able to get the shares with a large margin in the bid. In June 2005, Etisalat won the 26% of PTCL shares along with management control of the then telecom monopoly for US$2.6 billion. As of 2019, Etisalat has held back $800m amount over a property-transfer dispute with the Pakistani government. The government's plan of privatizing the corporation was not welcomed in all circles; countrywide protests and strikes were held by PTCL workers. They disrupted phone lines of institutions like Punjab University Lahore along with other public sector institutions.

In 2016, PTCL and Bahria Town tried to block ISPs from deploying fiber infrastructure in Bahria Town, effectively preserving a monopoly in that locality. The Competition Commission of Pakistan issued a show-cause notice, levied a PKR 2 million fine on Bahria Town, and ordered it to allow ISPs including Nayatel to lay fiber networks. On 14 February 2024, Nayatel lodged a complaint with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), alleging that PTCL blocked its IP traffic after Nayatel changed its bandwidth sourcing model to purchase from authorized resellers (such as Telenor Pakistan and Zong CMPak ), hence bypassing direct PTCL bandwidth contracts. PTCL reportedly refused to route Nayatel's traffic when bandwidth was purchased via resellers. In more recent scrutiny, the Competition Appellate Tribunal upheld CCP's earlier ruling against PTCL and other Long Distance International (LDI) operators regarding the International Clearing House (ICH) arrangement (2012), which had centralized inbound international calls via PTCL's gateway. The Tribunal reduced the penalty rate to 2 % of turnover from ICH operations but confirmed its anti-competitive nature. As of September 2025, the CCP has publicly accused PTCL of withholding data, delaying disclosures, and blocking regulatory scrutiny during the PTCL-Telenor merger process claiming that PTCL has a pattern of challenging PTA decisions in court, delaying interconnect obligations, and abusing dominance in multiple telecom segments.

The first three (in case of smaller cities, 4 or 5) signified the area code (e.g. 042 for Lahore) and the rest (7 for large cities, 6 or 5 for smaller ones) were the subscribers number. Due to the large demand for landlines in Lahore and Karachi, in 2009, PTCL decided to increase the 7-digit subscriber numbers to 8-digits, adding \"9\" before existing Government numbers and \"3\" before the others (e.g. the number 042\u20137878787 before 2009, was changed to 042\u201337878787). 5G trials PTCL successfully carried out 5G trials in February 2021 and achieved download speeds up to 1.7 Gbit/s in their testing environment. Acquisition of Telenor Pakistan After Telenor ASA announced in November 2022 that it would exit the Pakistani market, PTCL announced in December 2023 its intention to acquire Telenor Pakistan for US$ 493 million. PTCL Group CEO Hatem Bamatraf described the acquisition as a strategic move to strengthen digital infrastructure and improve customer experience.

History London South Africa was originally envisioned by Jason Smith, a South African sports agent, shortly after the Kolpak ruling . He had representations from ten South Africa national rugby union team players to establish a club in England for the South African expatriate community. There had previously been a South African expatriate team in England called London Springboks RFC who were founded in 1996 but merged with nearby Sudbury RFC three years later. Smith's initial plan was to purchase a National League 1 club, rename the club, relocate them to London and earn their way to promotion to the English Premiership . Eventually such a move failed so Smith moved lower down the divisions and started discussions with Wimbledon RFC to purchase the club and take over their position in London 2 South in 2004. However, in light of Smith's publicised plans and a rival operation called London Tribes RFC planning a similar move, Wimbledon rejected the offer and the Rugby Football Union also prohibited the attempt. As such, London South Africa were formed as a new club and made an application to join the Surrey Rugby Football Union . Their application was successful and they started playing in the bottom tier of English rugby. They initially started playing in Wimbledon but moved to Imber Court in Esher , Surrey. The club's name was challenged in court by a man who claimed he owned the trademark to the London South Africa name since 2000.

The steel cutting ceremony of the first ship was conducted on 10 August 2023. Development Concept Design The Philippine Navy included plans to procure 2 new landing platform docks as part of its Horizon 2 modernization phase, with the proposal with a budget of PHP5.56 billion among those approved in-principle by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in June 2018. This would allow the Philippine Navy to increase its sealift and amphibious assault capabilities to reach its planned overall capability.

The improvements were formulated based on the Philippine Navy's experience in operating the Tarlac -class, and knowing its strengths and shortcomings. Armaments The Philippine Navy released information to tenderers that the ships are to be built with allowance for a 76-millimeter (3.0 in) Oto Melara 76mm Super Rapid main gun, two 30mm Aselsan SMASH secondary guns, either the Rheinmetall Oerlikon Millennium Gun or the Aselsan GOKDENIZ gun", "source_type": "random"}

But changes in the Philippine Navy's requirement later on changed the design to have a hangar for one medium (10-ton) helicopter and a flight deck for two medium (10-ton) helicopters.

She was cast six days before filming. Reynolds: That was like starting King Kong' without the gorilla. I kept saying, She'll turn up, she'll turn up.' Then I saw Time magazine... I wanted an actress who could speak Italian and French, and since she was English, I thought she might have the kind of foreign attitude that I was seeking. When she came in my office and I heard her voice, deep like Bacall's, I thought she would be ideal. But Catherine Deneuve once told me that to judge how a beautiful woman will appear on the screen you must look through the camera and see if it has a love affair with her.

The stuntman was Dar Robinson . Despite it being a record-setting fall, only the beginning of the stunt, as he goes through the window, was used in the film. A dummy was used for the outside wide shot of the fall beside the skyscraper. Diehl, who was 50 when he wrote the novel, saw the movie shot on location in and around his hometown of Atlanta. El Mongol played the part of the limo driver in the film. Reynolds talked about his directing: Most directors cast actors on the basis of what they've seen before, and they don't want surprises; they want the actor to give another version of what he's already done. I try to do the opposite. I tell the actors, 'You've done that before, so let's go for something else.' On this picture I did with my actors what I always wanted other directors to do with me, which is to say, 'O.K., I have what I want, now you do what you want.' Sometimes magical things happen that way. I had lots of ideas, but I was open to any ideas the actors had. There really was a wonderful feeling of camaraderie. \"In my picture the good guys win and the bad guys, the dopers, lose,\" said Reynolds. \"That's important to me: I don't like dopers.

The following article is part of a biography of Sir Isaac Newton , the English mathematician and scientist, author of the Principia . It portrays the years after Newton's birth in 1643, his education, as well as his early scientific contributions, before the writing of his main work, the Principia Mathematica , in 1685. Overview of Newton's life Sir Isaac Newton is known for many scientific findings. These discoveries include the laws of motion, the theory of gravity, and basic calculus. Although Newton was predominantly known for his discoveries in mathematics and physics, he also put much effort and study into chemistry, biblical history, and optics. One of Newton's most famous writings was the Principia where he described some of his major findings of time, physics, mathematics, and calculus. Although his theories soon became universal, he faced much opposition to his early theories. Specifically, his theory of gravity faced criticism from leading scientists such as Christiaan Huygens and Leibniz. After a few years of debate, Newton's concept of gravity became universally accepted as he became the dominant figure in the European continent. Birth and education Isaac Newton was born 25 December 1642 Old Style (4 January 1643 on the Gregorian calendar , which is now used) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth , a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire . (At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the Gregorian calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as 25 December, according to the Julian calendar .)

Newton was born three months after the death of his father, a prosperous farmer also named Isaac Newton. His father was described as a \"wealthy and uneducated man\". Born prematurely , young Isaac was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother to burn them and the house over them.\" Later on his mother returned after her husband died. From age 12 to age 16, Newton resided with William Clarke , apothecary , in Grantham , where he acquired his interest in chemistry. While living with the Clarke family, Newton was educated at the free grammar school (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He spent much of his time on independent pursuits, and did poorly in school. Newton was also captivated with mechanical devices and drawing. Not only did he analyze drawings and machines, he actually constructed them himself. From windmills to clocks, Newton constructed models of many objects that surrounded him in his everyday life. He was removed from school, and by October 1659 he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him, which he hated.

This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report. Newton lived his childhood during some of the most turbulent times in England as the Civil War began in 1642. Although the effects of the country's issues may not have directly affected Newton, the school and universities in England were certainly impacted. Whether it was for the better or worse was to be determined, but Newton was certainly going to have a unique schooling due to the country's unbalance. Manuscript evidence shows that Newton's earliest known piece writing, a Latin phrasebook, as well as the first letter in his hand which has yet been found, addressed to a \u2018Loving friend\u2019, were copied from an unpublished version of a work on Latin pedagogy by William Walker, a schoolmaster and rector whose acquaintance with Newton is documented from 1665. This suggests an early influence of the schoolmaster on the natural philosopher when he was still a schoolboy. In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar \u2014a sort of work-study role. At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle , whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus , Galileo , and Kepler . In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became infinitesimal calculus .

Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the next two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation. In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a fellow of Trinity. Newton had stated that when he had purchased a book on astrology at Stourbridge fair , near Cambridge, he was unable, on account of his ignorance of trigonometry , to understand a figure of the heavens which was drawn in the book. He, therefore, bought an English edition of Euclid's Elements which included an index of propositions, and, having turned to two or three which he thought might be helpful, found them so obvious that he dismissed it \"as a trifling book\", and applied himself to the study of Ren\u00e9 Descartes ' Geometry . It is reported that in his examination for a scholarship at Trinity, to which he was elected on 28 April 1664, he was examined in Euclid by Isaac Barrow , who was disappointed in Newton's lack of knowledge of the subject. Newton was convinced to read the Elements again with care, and formed a more favourable opinion of Euclid's merit. Newton's study of Descartes' Geometry seems to have inspired him with a love of the subject, and introduced him to higher mathematics. In a small commonplace book , dated January 1664, there are several articles on angular sections, and the squaring of curves and \"crooked lines that may be squared\", several calculations about musical notes , geometrical propositions from Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te and Frans van Schooten , annotations out of John Wallis 's Arithmetic of Infinities , together with observations on refraction , on the grinding of \"spherical optic glasses\", on the errors of lenses and the method of rectifying them", "source_type": "random"}

In this same book the following entry made by Newton himself, many years afterward, gives a further account of the nature of his work during the period when he was an undergraduate: July 4, 1699. By consulting an account of my expenses at Cambridge, in the years 1663 and 1664, I find that in the year 1664 a little before Christmas, I being then Senior Sophister, bought Schooten's Miscellanies and Cartes' Geometry (having read this Geometry and Oughtred's Clavis clean over half a year before), and borrowed Wallis' works, and by consequence made these annotations out of Schooten and Wallis, in winter between the years 1664 and 1665. At such time I found the method of Infinite Series; and in summer 1665, being forced from Cambridge by the plague, I computed the area of the Hyperbola at Boothby , in Lincolnshire, to two and fifty figures by the same method. That Newton must have begun early to make careful observations of natural phenomena is shown by the following remarks about halos, which appear in his Optics , book ii. part iv. obs. 13: The like Crowns appear sometimes about the moon; for at the beginning of the Year 1664, February 19th, at night, I saw two such Crowns about her.

At the same time, there appeared a Halo about 22 Degrees 35' distant from the centre of the moon. It was elliptical, and its long Diameter was perpendicular to the Horizon, verging below farthest from the moon. He formulated the three laws of motion: Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. The relationship between an object's mass m , its acceleration a , and the applied force F is F = ma . Acceleration and force are vectors (as sometimes indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law, the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Academic career In January 1665 Newton took the degree of Bachelor of Arts . The persons appointed (in conjunction with the proctors, John Slade of Catharine Hall, Cambridge , and Benjamin Pulleyn of Trinity College, Newton's tutor) to examine the questionists were John Eachard of Catharine Hall and Thomas Gipps of Trinity University. It is a curious accident that we have no information about the respective merits of the candidates for a degree in this year since the \"ordo senioritis\" of the Bachelors of Arts for the year is omitted in the \"Grace Book\".

Both in 1665 and 1666 Trinity College was dismissed on account of the Great Plague of London . On each occasion it was agreed, as shown by entries in the \"Conclusion Book\" of the college, dated 7 August 1665, and 22 June 1666, and signed by the master of the college, Dr Pearson, that all fellows and scholars who were dismissed on account of the pestilence be allowed one month's commons. Newton must have left college before August 1665 , as his name does not appear in the list of those who received extra commons on that occasion, and he tells us himself in the extract from his commonplace book already quoted that he was \"forced from Cambridge by the plague\" in the summer of that year. He was elected a fellow of his college on 5 October 1667. There were nine vacancies, one caused by the death of Abraham Cowley the previous summer, and the nine successful candidates were all of the same academic standings. A few weeks after his election to a fellowship Newton went to Lincolnshire and did not return to Cambridge until the following February. In March 1668, he took his M.A. degree.

He wrote a paper, De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas , which he put, probably in June 1669, into the hands of Isaac Barrow (then Lucasian Professor of Mathematics ), at the same time permitting him to communicate its contents to their common friend John Collins (1624\u20131683), a mathematician of no mean order. Barrow did so on 31 July 1669, but kept the name of the author a secret, and merely told Collins that he was a friend staying at Cambridge, who had a powerful genius for such matters. In a subsequent letter on 20 August, Barrow expressed his pleasure at hearing the favourable opinion which Collins had formed of the paper, and added, \"the name of the author is Newton, a fellow of our college, and a young man, who is only in his second year since he took the degree of Master of Arts, and who, with an unparalleled genius ( examine quo est acumen ), has made very great progress in this branch of mathematics\". Shortly afterward, Barrow resigned his chair and was instrumental in securing Newton's election as his successor. Newton was appointed Lucasian professor on 29 October 1669. It was his duty as professor to lecture at least once a week in term time on some portion of geometry , arithmetic , astronomy , geography , optics , statics , or some other mathematical subject, and also for two hours in the week to allow an audience to any student who might come to consult with the professor on any difficulties he had encountered.

An account of their content was presented to the Royal Society in the spring of 1672. During the year 1684, Edmund Halley visited the home of Newton. While on his visit, Halley noted the remarkable development Newton had conducted regarding the path of objects in space such as stars and planets. Newton was convinced to step forward and introduce his findings to the general public which soon became publicized. The publication, \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\" introduced the three laws that Newton became famous for: law of inertia, summation of forces equals mass multiplied by acceleration and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Prior to Newton, there were several other philosophers who proposed ideas to describe the motion of celestial bodies. Kepler and Galileo Galilei often studied the way objects fell in order to gain an understanding of the motion of the planets. However, by putting his theories into laws, it was Newton who achieved the most success. Students learn these concepts in grade school, being applicable to every conceivable aspect of life. In the year 1688, Newton was elected to the convention parliament at Cambridge University where he remained on board for two years. During his time at Cambridge, he was able to meet several famous people like John Locke and Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. Newton was able to form life-long bonds with these two figures in the matter of two years. Christiaan Huygens also came into the picture as Newton and him had disagreements in the past about gravity.

He began by editing his book, Principia . Despite the adjustments he made, the new version of Principia was abandoned by the year 1693 due to Newton's mental state. He decaled himself as having a mental breakdown which eradicated the adjustments he made to his famous writing. Newton had a different novel that he worked on during the same time period called Praxis. This text consists of five drafts of literature written by Newton having to do with chemistry. During this period, Newton studied several areas of work including religion, calculus and chemistry. A replica of a second reflecting telescope Newton presented to the Royal Society in 1672 (the first one he made in 1668 was loaned to an instrument maker but there is no further record of what happened to it). It is described as the better of the instruments Newton built. According to Alfred Rupert Hall the first practical reflecting telescope was built by Newton in 1668. Later on, such a prototype for its design came to be called a Newtonian telescope or Newton's reflector . On 21 December 1671 he was proposed as a candidate for admission to the Royal Society by Dr. Seth Ward , bishop of Salisbury , and on 11 January 1672, he was elected a fellow of the Society. At the meeting at which Newton was elected, he read a description of a reflecting telescope which he had invented, and \"it was ordered that a letter should be written by the secretary to Mr. Newton to acquaint him of his election into the Society, and to thank him for the communication of his telescope , and to assure him that the Society would take care that all right should be done him concerning this invention.\" In his reply to the secretary on", "source_type": "random"}

The whole is printed in No. 80 of the Philosophical Transactions . Newton's \"philosophical discovery\" was the realisation that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. He realised that objects are coloured only because they absorb some of these colours more than others. After he explained this to the Society, he proceeded: \"When I understood this, I left off my aforesaid glassworks; for I saw, that the perfection of telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions of Optics Authors (which all men have hitherto imagined), as because that light itself is a heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible rays.

He then points out why \"the object-glass of any telescope cannot collect all the rays which come from one point of an object, to make them convene at its focus in less room than in a circular space, whose diameter is the 50th part of the diameter of its aperture: which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater, than a circularly figured lens, of so small a section as the object-glasses of long telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its figure, were light uniform.\" He adds: \"This made me take reflections into consideration, and finding them regular so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was equal to their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their mediation optic instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided a reflecting substance could be found, which would polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much light, as glass transmits, and the art of communicating to it a parabolic figure be also attained. But these seemed very great difficulties, and I have almost thought them insuperable, when I further considered, that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course, than the like irregularities in a refracting one; so that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite, than in figuring glasses for refraction. \"Amidst these thoughts, I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening Plague, and it was more than two years", "source_type": "random"}

I could also discern the Moon -like phase of Venus , but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in disposing of the instrument. \"From that time I was interrupted until this last autumn when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better than the first (especially for day-objects), so I doubt not, but they will be still brought to much greater perfection by their endeavours, who, as you inform me, are taking care of it at London.\" Newton's theory of colour After a remark that microscopes seem as capable of improvement as telescopes, he adds: I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable deformity in its Rays, were in the intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And this analogy twist colours, and refrangibility is very precise and strict; the rays always either exactly agreeing in both, or proportionally disagreeing in both. Further on, after some remarks on the subject of compound colours, he says: I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall conclude with this general one, that the colours of all-natural bodies have no other origin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty than another.

They have there no appropriate colour, but ever appear of the colour of the light cast upon them, but yet with this difference, that they are most brisk and vivid in the light of their daylight colour. Minium appears thereof any colour indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red, and so Bise appears indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blue. And there place a clear and colourless prism, to refract the entering light towards the further part of the room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured image. Then place a lens of about three-foot radius (suppose a broad object-glass of a three-foot telescope), at the distance of about four or five foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, and made by its refraction to convene at a further distance of about ten or twelve feet. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whiteness again by being mingled. But it is requisite, that the prism and lens be placed steadily, and that the paper, on which the colours are cast be moved to and fro; for, by such motion, you will not only find, at what distance the whiteness is almost perfect but also see, how the colours gradually convene and vanish into whiteness, and afterward having crossed one another in that place where they compound whiteness,", "source_type": "random"}

You may also see, that, if any of the colours at the lens be intercepted, the whiteness will be changed into the other colours. And therefore, that the composition of whiteness be perfect, care must be taken, that none of the colours fall beside the lens. He concludes his communication with the words: This, I conceive, is enough for an introduction to experiments of this kind: which if any of the R. Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what success: if anything seems to be defective, or to thwart this relation, I may have an opportunity of giving further direction about it, or of acknowledging my errors, if I have committed any. Controversies The publication of these discoveries led to a series of controversies which lasted for several years, in which Newton had to contend with the eminent English physicist Robert Hooke , Anthony Lucas (mathematical professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge ), Franciscus Linus (a physician in Li\u00e8ge ), and many others. Some of his opponents denied the truth of his experiments, refusing to believe in the existence of the spectrum. Others criticised the experiments, saying that the length of the spectrum was never more than three and a half times the breadth , whereas Newton found it to be five times the breadth. It appears that Newton made the mistake of supposing that all prisms would give a spectrum of the same length; the objections of his opponents led him to measure carefully the lengths of spectra formed by prisms of different angles and different refractive indices , but he was not led thereby", "source_type": "random"}

Newton carried on the discussion with the objectors with great courtesy and patience, but the pain which these long discussions gave to his sensitive mind may be estimated from his letter of 18 November 1676 to Oldenburg : \"I promised to send you an answer to Mr. Lucas this next Tuesday, but I find I shall scarce finish what I have designed, to get a copy taken of it by that time, and therefore I beg your patience a week longer. I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy, but if I get free of Mr. Lucas's business, I will resolutely bid adieu to it eternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave to come out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or to become a slave to defend it.\" These disputes did not damp Newton's ardour as much as he feared. He later published many papers in the Philosophical Transactions on various aspects of optics, and, although some of his views are erroneous, and are now almost universally rejected, his investigations led to discoveries which are of permanent value. He succeeded in explaining the colour of thin and of thick plates ( diffraction ), and the inflexion of light, and he wrote on double refraction, light polarisation and binocular vision . He also invented a reflecting quadrant for observing the angles between the Moon and the fixed stars\u2014 the same in every essential as the historically important navigational instrument more commonly known as Hadley's quadrant .

Conflict over oratorship elections In March 1673 Newton took a prominent part in a dispute in the university. The public oratorship fell vacant, and a contest arose between the heads of the colleges and the members of the Senate as to the mode of electing to the office. The heads claimed the right of nominating two persons, one of whom was to be elected by the senate. The senate insisted that the proper mode was by an open election. George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham , who was the chancellor of the university, endeavoured to effect a compromise which, he says, \"I hope may for the present satisfy both sides. I propose that the heads may for this time nominate and the body comply, yet interposing (if they think fit) a protestation concerning their plea that this election may not hereafter pass for a decisive precedent in prejudice of their claim\", and, \"whereas I understand that the whole university has chiefly consideration for Dr Henry Paman of St John's College and Mr. Craven of Trinity College, I do recommend them both to be nominated.\" The heads, however, nominated Drs Paman and Ralph Sanderson (of St John's); the next day 121 members of the senate recorded their votes for Craven and ninety-eight for Paman. On the morning of the election, a protest in which Newton's name appeared was read and entered in the Regent House. But the vice-chancellor admitted Paman the same morning, and so ended the first contest of a non-scientific character in which Newton took part.

The most probable reason why Newton wished to be excused from these payments is that, as he was not in holy orders, his fellowship at Trinity College would lapse in autumn 1675, with a consequent reduction in his income. But he received a patent from the Crown in April 1675, allowing him as Lucasian professor to retain his fellowship without being required to take holy orders.

They are said to have been inspired by Newton's seeing an apple fall from a tree on his mother's farm, a version for which there is reasonable historical evidence. In one version of the story, the apple is supposed to have fallen on Newton's head; this version appears to have been invented by Isaac D'Israeli . Voltaire is the authority for the former version of the story. He had his information from Newton's favourite niece Catherine Barton , who married John Conduitt , a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of Newton's intimate friends. How much truth there is in what is a plausible and a favourite story can never be known, but it is certain that tradition marked a tree as that from which the apple fell, until 1866, when, owing to decay, the tree was cut down and its wood carefully preserved. Johannes Kepler had proved by an elaborate series of measurements that each planet revolves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun, whose centre occupies one of the foci of the ellipse, that the radius vector of each planet drawn from the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, and that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun. The fact that heavy bodies always have a tendency to fall to the Earth, no matter at what height they are placed above the Earth's surface, seems to have led Newton to conjecture that the same tendency to fall to the Earth might have been the cause by which the Moon was retained in its orbit around the Earth.

Newton, by calculating from Kepler's laws , and supposing the orbits of the planets to be circles with the sun at the centre, had already proved that the force of the Sun acting upon the different planets must vary as the inverse square of the distances of the planets from the Sun. He was therefore led to inquire whether if the Earth's attraction extended to the Moon, the force at that distance would be of the exact magnitude necessary to retain the Moon in its orbit. He found that the Moon by its motion in its orbit was deflected from the tangent in every minute through a space of 13 feet (3.96 m). But by observing the distance through which a body would fall in one second at the Earth's surface, and by calculating from that on the supposition of the force diminishing in the ratio of the inverse square of the distance, he found that the Earth's attraction at the distance of the Moon would draw a body through 15 ft. (4.57 metres) in one minute. Newton regarded the discrepancy between the results as proof of the inaccuracy of his conjecture, and \"laid aside at that time any further thoughts of this matter\". (See Newton's cannonball .) In November 1679, Robert Hooke (after his appointment to manage the Royal Society's correspondence) began an exchange of letters with Newton : he wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others. The correspondence later led to controversy. Hooke and Newton disagreed about the form of the path of a body falling from a height, taking the motion of the Earth around its axis into consideration.

Newton later acknowledged that the exchanges of 1679\u201380 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomy. This led Newton to revert to his former conjectures on the Moon. The estimate Newton had used for the radius of the Earth, which had been accepted by geographers and navigators, was based on the very rough estimate that the length of a degree of latitude of the Earth's surface measured along a meridian was 60 nautical miles. At a meeting of the Royal Society on 11 January 1672, Oldenburg, the secretary, read a letter from Paris describing the procedure followed by Jean Picard in measuring a degree, and specifically stating the precise length that he calculated it to be. It is probable that Newton had become acquainted with this measurement of Picard's, and that he was therefore led to make use of it when his thoughts were redirected to the subject. This estimate of the Earth's magnitude, giving 691 miles (1112 km) to 10\u00b0, made the two results, the discrepancy between which Newton had regarded as a disproof of his conjecture, to agree so exactly that he now regarded his conjecture as fully established. In January 1684, Sir Christopher Wren , Halley and Hooke were led to discuss the law of gravity, and although they probably all agreed on the truth of the inverse square law, yet this truth was not looked upon as established. It appears that Hooke professed to have a solution of the problem of the path of a body moving around a centre of force attracting as the inverse square of the distance, but Halley declared after a delay of some months that Hooke \"had not been so good as his word\" in showing his solution to Wren and started for Cambridge, in August 1684, to consult Newton on the subject.

Newton replied promptly, \"an ellipse\", and on being questioned by Halley as to the reason for his answer he replied, \"Why, I have calculated it.\" He could not, however, put his hand upon his calculation, but he promised to send it to Halley. After the latter had left Cambridge, Newton set to work to reproduce the calculation. After making a mistake and producing a different result he corrected his work and obtained his former result. Next November, Newton redeemed his promise to Halley by sending him, by the hand of Mr. Paget, a fellow of Trinity College and mathematical master of Christ's Hospital , a copy of his demonstration; and very soon afterward Halley again visited Cambridge to confer with Newton about the problem. On his return to London on 10 December 1684, he informed the Royal Society \"that he had lately seen Mr. Newton at Cambridge, who had shown him a curious treatise De Motu \", which at Halley's desire he promised to send to the Society to be entered upon their register. \"Mr. Halley was desired to put Mr. Newton in mind of his promise for the securing this invention to himself, till he could be at leisure to publish it\", and Paget was desired to join with Halley in urging Newton to do so.

Dickens's hand was so prominent\u2014beside acting in the play for several performances, he added a preface , altered lines, and attended to most of the props and sets\u2014that the principal edition of the play is entitled \"Under the Management of Charles Dickens\". John C. Eckel wrote: \"As usual with a play which passed into rehearsal under Dickens' auspices it came out improved. This was the case with The Frozen Deep . The changes were so numerous that the drama almost may be ascribed to Dickens\". Dickens himself took the part of Richard Wardour and was stage-manager during its modest original staging in Dickens's home Tavistock House . The play, however, grew in influence through a series of outside performances, including one before Queen Victoria at the Royal Gallery of Illustration , and a three-performance run at the Manchester Free Trade Hall for the benefit of the Douglas Jerrold Fund to benefit the widow of Dickens's old friend, Douglas Jerrold . There, night after night, everyone\u2014including, by some accounts, the carpenters and the stage-hands\u2014was moved to tears by the play. It also brought Dickens together with Ellen Ternan , an actress he hired to play one of the parts, and for whom he would later leave his wife Catherine . The play remained unpublished until a private printing appeared sometime in 1866. Genesis The play's genesis lay in the conflict between Dickens and John Rae's report on the fate of the Franklin expedition . In May 1845, the \"Franklin expedition\" left England in search of the Northwest Passage . It was last seen in July 1845, after which the members of the expedition were lost without trace.

In October 1854, John Rae (using reports from \" Eskimo \" ( Inuit ) eyewitnesses, who informed that they had seen 40 \"white men\" and later 35 corpses) described the fate of the Franklin expedition in a confidential report to the Admiralty : \"From the mutilated state of many of the corpses and the contents of the kettles it is evident that our wretched countrymen had been driven to the last resource\u2014cannibalism\u2014as a means of prolonging survival.\" This blunt report was presented under the assumption that truth would be preferred to uncertainty. The Admiralty made this report public. Rae's report caused much distress and anger. The public mistakenly believed, with Lady Franklin , that the Arctic explorer was \"clean, Christian and genteel\" and that an Englishman was able to \"survive anywhere\" and \"to triumph over any adversity through faith, scientific objectivity, and superior spirit.\" Dickens not only wrote to discredit the Inuit evidence, he attacked the Inuit character using racist stereotypes, writing: \"We believe every savage in his heart covetous, treacherous, and cruel: and we have yet to learn what knowledge the white man\u2014lost, houseless, shipless, apparently forgotten by his race, plainly famine-stricken, weak, frozen and dying\u2014has of the gentleness of Exquimaux nature.\" Jen Hill writes that Dickens's \"invocation of racialized stereotypes of cannibalistic behavior foregrounded Rae's own foreignness.\" John Rae was a Scot, not English, and thus held to not be \"pledged to the patriotic, empire-building aims of the military.\" The play by Dickens and Wilkie Collins , The Frozen Deep , was an allegorical play about the missing Arctic expedition.

The Rae character was turned into a suspicious, power-hungry nursemaid who predicted the expedition's doom in her effort to ruin the happiness of the delicate heroine. Performances The Frozen Deep was first performed at Tavistock House at a dress rehearsal on 5 January 1857 for an informal audience of servants and tradespeople. Semi-public performances followed on 6, 8, 12 and 14 January for audiences of about 90 at each, including numerous friends of Dickens and Collins, among them members of Parliament , judges, and ministers. Following the death of Jerrold , Dickens planned benefit performances for the support of his widow and children. The first of these, on 4 July, was a command performance at the Royal Gallery of Illustration for Queen Victoria, Prince Albert , and their family; among the other guests were King Leopold I of Belgium , Prince Frederick William of Prussia , and his fianc\u00e9e Princess Victoria , along with literary lights William Thackeray and Hans Christian Andersen . Victoria praised the performance, especially Dickens's acting, in her diary. Additional performances at the same venue were given on 11, 18 and 25 July. When Dickens realised that, despite expensive ticket prices, insufficient funds had been raised to sustain Mrs. Jerrold, he arranged for a series of much larger public performances at the Manchester Free Trade Hall . It was for these that Dickens, convinced that his amateur actresses, including his daughters Kate and Mary Dickens , would not be able to project in such a large venue, replaced them with professionals, among them Ellen Ternan.

Revivals The Frozen Deep was not again produced under the aegis of Dickens. It was briefly revived in a revised version with Wilkie Collins 's blessing in 1866, but was a relative flop, leaving Collins convinced that it should no longer be staged. Instead, he undertook a rewriting of the entire play as a novella, which was published in book form and became a regular text for his successful public readings both in Britain and the United States. Its only other revival was in 2005 at the Edinburgh Festival , when a completely new dramatic version, adapted in turn from Collins's prose version, was staged by the Ironduke company. Described as \"dark and moody\" by reviewers, it was not a particular success, although in the wake of its appearance Collins's novella came back into print for the first time in many decades.

The game was introduced in Nepal by the young players who had learnt this game from other countries. Games was watched by a huge mass of audience and became very famous at that time. However, it is believed that the pioneer of this game in Nepal was Narayan Narsingh Rana of Thamel and Chandrajung Thapa of Naxal. There were some places, which were used as football ground for palace teams, such as Sujan Khanal, Mrigendra Shamsher Niwas Babarmahal, Mahabir Niwas Tangal Palace, Narshamsher Niwas Singha Durbar, Rudra Shamsher Niwas Bhahadur Bhavan, and Thamel Narsingh camp. Whereas in the 1930s, both local and palace teams commonly used the grounds of Singhdarbar, Chhauni, Gaucharan, Jawalakhel and Lainchaur for playing football.

Formation of the FA (1288) Development Football development in Nepal had only been possible when ANFA started working from root level. Keeping this in mind, ANFA has given its work priority for building fundamental material for the association. Firstly, ANFA has built a hostel in Satdobato, Lalitpur which has shown their dedication toward the development of football in Nepal by opening an ANFA office with a playground. This work of ANFA has been appreciated everywhere. Before starting a major project, the Federation of International Football Association ( FIFA ) provided ANFA an opportunity to represent as a model in FIFA congress. ANFA has built technical centers (or football academies) in Chyasal of Lalitpur , Butwal , Rupandehi , Sunsari and Dharan under the roof of the FIFA Goal project. Similarly, ANFA has planned to open technical centers in the Mid-Western and Far-Western development regions of Nepal in the future.

The redevelopment of the AXA Towers were first announced on 7 July 2022, when redevelopment plans for a new 63-storey building with a height of 1,001 feet (305 metres) were approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority for a consortium consisting of Alibaba, Perennial Holdings, and local partners. This marked the new building as the tallest skyscraper ever approved to be constructed in Singapore.

Construction and design AXA Tower in September 2022, after it was closed to the public and preparations for demolition had begun. In May 2022, AXA Tower was closed and demolition began shortly after. The new building will retain the AXA tower's foundation, to reduce materials used in the construction and to reduce environmental impact during redevelopment. A S$ 3 billion real estate green loan was secured by Perennial Holdings and its partners in November 2022 for the development of the site, with sustainability construction being incorporated into the design and development of the new building.

She has appeared on Good Morning America , The Oprah Winfrey Show , Dateline NBC and the Today Show , in addition to other nationally and locally televised programs. Her research interests include genetic and environmental influences on human behavior, especially social relationships and bereavement. Her research program includes twin and adoption studies that are specially designed to address problems and issues concerning human development in general, and twin development in particular. Research Segal's main research focuses on human behavior and includes cooperation and competition, altruism, personal bonds, and bereavement. She studies twins to understand social relationships in the general population, hoping to derive implications for what makes people get along. She finds that identical twins generally work together more cooperatively than others. In addition to studying identical twins (who result from the splitting of one egg fertilized by one sperm and who share all of their genes) and fraternal twins (who come from two eggs fertilized by different sperm and who share on average half their genes, just as non-twin siblings do), Segal is the only researcher known to study \"virtual\" or \"pseudo\" twins. These are two people less than nine months apart in age but with different biological parents, who are raised together from infancy. Her studies in progress show a modest degree of similarity in virtual twins for general intelligence and special mental abilities. Segal sees great promise in a related new area of research, epigenomics , which refers to natural chemical modifications that take place in individual genomes, marking them for increased or decreased activity.

It has been shown to be a target of autoantibodies in the human autoimmune diseases, polymyositis or dermatomyositis Besides its role in translation, Lysyl-tRNA synthetase is involved in a signaling pathway leading to gene activation. Following physiological stimulation of a variety of cells, Lysyl-tRNA synthetase binds to the transcription factors MITF and USF2 and can then influence their transcriptional activities. Such physiological stimulation includes immunological activation of mast cells, so this pathway maybe relevant to the allergic response. Interactions KARS (gene) has been shown to interact with Multisynthetase complex auxiliary component p38 . Physiological trigger such as immunological activation results in the phosphorylation of LysRS on its serine residues. It separates from the multisynthetase complex and initiates Ap4A production.

It has the largest database available of contact information on residents of the United States . Whitepages was founded in 1997 as a hobby for then- Stanford student Alex Algard . It was incorporated in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps , a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products. History Founding The idea for Whitepages was conceived by Alex Algard , while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard was searching for a friend's contact information, and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs . He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually, Whitepages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job to focus on the website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000. Growth The site grew and attracted more advertisers. The company brokered deals with Yellowpages and Superpages, whereby Whitepages earned revenue for sending them referral traffic. By 2005, $15 million in annual revenues was coming from these contracts. In 2003, Algard stepped down as CEO to focus on CarDomain.com , which he had", "source_type": "random"}

In 2003, Algard stepped down as CEO to focus on CarDomain.com , which he had also founded and Max Bardon took his place as CEO temporarily. In 2005, Technology Crossover Ventures and Providence Equity Partners invested $45 million in the company. That same year, MSN adopted Whitepages' directory data for its \"Look it up\" feature. Algard returned to the company in 2007. By the end of that year, the Whitepages database had grown to 180 million records and the company was listed as one of Deloitte 's 500 fastest growing technology companies in North America three times. By 2008 the company had $66 million in annual revenues. In 2008, Whitepages said it would start working on options for users to control their information on the site. That same year, it acquired VoIP developer Snapvine in order to add features where users could be called through the website without giving out their phone number. It also introduced an api , which gave third-party developers access to Whitepages' data. Whitepages released an iOS app that August, followed by the Whitepages Caller ID app for Android devices in February 2009 and for Blackberry that May. The app displayed information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October. Whitepages.com underwent a re-design in 2009.

A local business lookup feature called \" Store Finder \" was added in June 2010. The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com, which differed from Groupon by offering short-term deals on nationally available products. Dealpop was sold to Tippr the following year. In 2010, Superpages and Yellowpages cut back spending with Whitepages from $33 million to $7 million, causing a substantial decline in revenues and a tense relationship with investors. Algard spent $50 million in cash the company had on-hand and $30 million from a bank loan, to buyout the investors in 2013. He also used his personal house, savings account and personal belongings as collateral for the loan. Algard began shifting the company's business model to reduce its reliance on advertising and instead focus on business users and paid subscriptions. Whitepages released the Localicious app in July 2011. The app was released on Android first, because Whitepages was frustrated with Apple's approval process for iPhone apps. Whitepages PRO was also introduced that same year. An updated Android app called Current Caller ID was released in August 2012. Within a year of its release, 5 billion calls and texts had been transmitted using the app. It was updated in July 2013 with new features, such as the ability to customize the layout of caller information for each caller and the ability to \"like\" Facebook posts from within the app. In June 2013, Whitepages acquired Mr. Number, an Android app for blocking unwanted callers.

In his writings he reveals that he spent seventeen years traveling through Iraq , Anatolia , Yemen , North Africa , and Syria . Historical scholars almost unanimously agree that he belongs to Egypt, so they called him al-Masry (the Egyptian).

He is famous for his concern for the authenticity of transmission, so his works are considered of high value to historians of science. In addition, his collection of the works of the predecessors in chemistry, his preservation of them, and his analysis of their content preserved much of the heritage that was lost from them. He was also fond of the natural sciences and plants, and was keen to delve into their topics and read the most important books on these sciences. He did not leave a book on chemistry without reading and commenting on it. He was known for his generosity, piety, spreading knowledge, and caring for seekers of knowledge. He would open his home to students of knowledge, and would open his heart to anyone who asked him for questions or clarification on issues of chemistry or other branches of knowledge. Al-Jaldaki was distinguished by his writing in a style that was difficult to understand. Some people sometimes accuse him of being a style that is closer to talisman for the average reader, but this does not fault him because he was writing for specialists in the field of chemistry. Manouchehr Taslimi mentioned in his doctoral thesis from the University of London in 1954 that Al-Jaldaki spent seventeen years on his scientific travels. He laid the basic building block for the creation of the \" Law of definite Proportions \" in chemical union, and explained it in detail, which Kepler , Galileo , and Newton later relied on in their studies. It is the law that Joseph Proust , who was born five centuries after Al-Jaldaki, falsely claimed for himself.

The genus is found in the Indian and western Pacific oceans. Taxonomy Cocotropus was first described as a genus in 1858 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup as a monotypic genus, the only species classified within it being Corythobatus echinatus , which had been described in 1849 by the Danish zoologist Theodore Cantor from Penang in Malaysia. The genus Cocotropus is classified within the family Aploactinidae in the suborder Scorpaenoidei within the order Scorpaeniformes , although this family is also treated as a subfamily of the stonefish family Synanceiidae within the Scorpaenoidei, which in turn is treated as a superfamily within the order Perciformes. The name of the genus, Cocotropus was not explained by Kaup but may be a compound of coccum , which means \"scarlet\", and tropus , meaning \"manner\" or \"way\", so a \"scarlet fish\", however C. echinatus is reddish brown rather than scarlet. Species There are currently 17 recognized species in this genus: Cocotropus altipinnis Waite , 1903 (Highfin velvetfish) Cocotropus astakhovi Prokofiev , 2010 Cocotropus aurantius Matsunuma , Sado & Motomura , 2021 Cocotropus dermacanthus ( Bleeker , 1852) Cocotropus echinatus ( Cantor , 1849) Cocotropus eksae Prokofiev, 2010 Cocotropus izuensis Imamura , Aizawa & G.

She took part in several actions against the French navy, and flew the flag of Admiral Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport , during the Battle of Groix . She caught fire and sank on 17 March 1800. The second HMS Queen Charlotte (1810) was a 104-gun first rate, launched in 1810, led the Bombardment of Algiers on 27 August 1816, was renamed Excellent in 1859 and sold in 1892. The third Queen Charlotte (1810 ship) was a ship-sloop constructed for the Upper Canada Provincial Marine on the Great Lakes . The ship was commissioned in 1813 into the Royal Navy and the United States captured her on 10 September 1813 following the Battle of Lake Erie . The United States Navy commissioned her but laid her up and sold her into commercial service in 1825. Her owners finally abandoned her in 1844.

Life and career Born to Norval and Kathleen White, he had four siblings and volunteered for the 1980 Reagan presidential campaign before he could vote. In 1979, he attended a YMCA model legislature and introduced a 'bill' requiring 11 months of reserve military service for all 18-year-old males. He was also a member of the Boy Scouts and volunteered at a muscular dystrophy camp. In 1980, he introduced another bill in the model legislature that called for Missouri to withdraw from the union, and a list of \"present abuses and injustices\" of the federal government. Rejected by West Point , he intended to join the Army directly but was persuaded by his parents to attend Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri . The school commandant remembered White as an introvert and a loner. White subsequently dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army as an infantryman. After completing basic and advanced individual training, White was assigned to 1st Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment in South Korea. At around 2 a.m., on August 28, 1982, he shot the lock off one of the gates leading into the Korean Demilitarized Zone and was witnessed by fellow soldiers walking through the DMZ from Guard Post Ouellette, near Kaesong with a duffle bag full of documents he stole from the site including the layout of mines which were buried on the South Korean side of the DMZ.

He surrendered to North Korean troops. He was the first American soldier to request asylum in North Korea since January 1965 and the fifth since the Korean War . North Korean authorities refused a request by United Nations Command representatives to meet White and ask him about the reasons for his defection. North Korean authorities released a video of White, in which he denounced the United States' \"corruptness, criminality, immorality, weakness, and hedonism,\" affirming he had defected to demonstrate how \"unjustifiable for the U.S. to send troops to South Korea \", before leading a chant in homage to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung . Prior to White's defection, Charles Jenkins , in 1965, was the last U.S. soldier to cross the demilitarized zone into North Korea. Jenkins wrote in his memoirs that he never met White, but once saw him on state television at a press conference soon after the defection. He also wrote that plans were in the works for White to share housing with one of the other American defectors, but it eventually fell through. According to Jenkins' contacts in government, White suffered an epileptic seizure of some form and was left paralyzed. Following that, Jenkins heard nothing more about him. In February 1983, White's parents received a letter from their son, stating that he was happy in North Korea and working as an English teacher. In November 1985, his parents received a letter penned by a North Korean contact of White, stating that their son had died by drowning in the Ch'ongch'on River in August 1985, and his body was not recovered. A copy of the letter was released by Dick Gephardt , then a Congressman representing Missouri , in early 1986.

It was designed as the replacement for the 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3) . The gun was no longer in front-line service with the Russian Ground Forces , until being pressed back into service in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2023. Wartime service included use by communist forces during the Vietnam War and by Arab forces during their conflicts with Israel. Overview The design of the D-44 started in 1943 at the design bureau of No.9 factory \" Uralmash \" and production began in 1944. Its GRAU code was 52-P-367 . The SD-44 was a 1950s variant with an auxiliary propulsion unit and ammunition box for 10 rounds, with 697 issued to the airborne forces (VDV) from 1954. The D-44N was a 1960s variant with an APN 3-7 infra-red illumination device for night combat. China received D-44s during the Korean War and began manufacturing a copy, the Type 56, in the early 1960s. Finally, the Polish Army has equipped some of their D-44 guns with electrical subsystems in the early 1980s and designated them D-44M and D-44MN . The barrel was developed from that of the T-34-85 tank and was capable of firing 20\u201325 high-explosive (HE), armor-piercing, and high-explosive antitank (HEAT) projectiles per minute.

The post-war round O-365K HE weighed 9.5 kg and packed 741 grams of TNT as its bursting charge, while the BK-2M HEAT-FS (fin-stabilized) projectile can penetrate 300 mm of armor. The HEAT round for the Type 56 has a maximum range of 970 meters and will penetrate 100 mm of armor at an angle of 65 degrees. The gun uses GAZ-AA tires, and is towed by a 2.5t truck or a Ya-12 tractor with the average speed of 20\u201325 km/h on surfaced roads, and 11 km/h over open terrain, with a maximum towing speed over asphalt roadway of about 55 km/h. The SD-44's auxiliary propulsion unit M-72 of 14 hp can move the gun at road speeds up to 25 km/h. The gun uses the OP-2-7 sight with 5.5x magnification for day combat. The sight permits target acquisition at 1500 meters. Production The D-44 was produced from 1945 until 1953. During the years 1948-1950, over two thousand D-44s were produced per year.

History The Atlantic Club of Bulgaria was created in 1990 around the pro- NATO lobby in the first post- Cold War Bulgarian Parliament . It was born when its founder, Solomon Passy , also the owner of a Trabant automobile, welcomed Manfred W\u00f6rner and gave him a tour of Sofia in a Trabant. Officially established on 4 April 1991, the Atlantic Club has grown to include members from all walks of life: government, academia, military, business and media. The Atlantic Club was the first Atlantic NGO outside NATO, founded on Warsaw Pact territory, and the first non-NATO member (since 1992) of the Atlantic Treaty Association (ATA). The Club raised the funds, and jointly with the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute, organized the resumption of Bulgaria's Antarctic activities in 1993, the upgrading of the Bulgarian refuge on Livingston Island and its redesignation as St. Kliment Ohridski Base , as well as the construction of a new main building of the base started during the 1995/96 season. The Atlantic Club initiated a national committee that organized the visit of Pope John Paul II to Bulgaria in 2002, and also co-hosted the mass rally for U.S. President Bill Clinton who visited Sofia in 1999, and another one for US Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2003. In 2004, Bulgaria joined NATO. After attending the Nobel Prize Ceremony in Oslo in 2012, Solomon Passy suggested that the EU should nominate Bulgaria for the Nobel Peace Prize next year.

Parts of the building are 13th century and there is evidence there was a church here before this in Saxon times. It is situated in the old village of Hatfield just east of the modern town of Hatfield and close to the walls of Hatfield House , once a royal palace. It once served Hatfield House, as well as the village, as a place of worship and is exceptionally grand for a parish church. The dedication to St Etheldreda derives from the Bishops of Ely for whom she is a patron saint . She once occupied the House when it was a bishops' palace. Description The church stands at the top of a hill with Old Hatfield village centre to the west. The building material is largely flint . It is cruciform with a tower at the western end. Most construction was between the 13th and 15th centuries. Two chapels have been added on either side of the chancel ; on the north side is the Salisbury Chapel and on the south side the Brocket Chapel . The Salisbury Chapel is the traditional burial place of the Cecil family and contains the ornate tomb of Robert Cecil , the first Earl of Salisbury. Two British Prime Ministers, Lord Melbourne and Lord Salisbury (both the first and last Prime Ministers of Queen Victoria 's reign), are also interred here. Some rebuilding, particularly of the window tracery , was done during the Victorian era. Historically, St Etheldreda's Church had a steeple on top of the west tower and this is shown in many early illustrations.

When a big boat was under construction, he might employ 15 or 20 men to work on her. Many of these men also had small yards where they built smaller boats \u2013 \"Abaco Dinghies\" which became the backbone of the fishing and commercial industry of the Bahamas. In 1960, Edwin Albury started Edwin's Boat Yard. He, Keith Albury and Darvin Sands built boats of varying sizes during the 60s and were joined by Blake Albury in 1969. Edwin Albury expanded in 1976 when he bought out William H. Albury. Joe Albury now builds Abaco Dinghies in his yard.

It is his first collaboration with producer Chet Atkins . Background According to the book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville , Chet Atkins first heard of Jennings through comedian Don Bowman , who had worked with Waylon on the radio in Lubbock , and country singer Bobby Bare . In March 1965, the singer made his first recordings for RCA in what would be a moderately successful but increasingly frustrated artistic partnership. In the authorized Jennings documentary Renegade Outlaw Legend , Jennings recalled that at the time he was in awe of the legendary Atkins: \"That's God's right hand as far as country music. When you walked in there, the most important thing in your life is to impress him.\" The album bears little resemblance to the sound Jennings would pioneer in the 1970s as part of the \" outlaw \" movement, with Atkins tempering Waylon's assertive vocal style and surrounding him with the hallmarks of the \" Nashville sound \" that had been enormously successful for previous RCA artists like Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves . Author Michael Striessguth observes in his book Outlaws : \"Chet threw plenty of Waylon's records against the wall and more than a few stuck...Waylon in the mid-1960s was controlled, even gentle, which helped put over the polite sound that defined much of his repertoire, but not his true style...So Waylon's early hits found him reaching for distant places in his range on songs such as Harlan Howard 's \"Another Bridge to Burn\", Don Bowman's \"Now Everybody Knows\" and Waylon's own arrangement of \" Man of Constant Sorrow \", all of them drenched in background vocals as if they were Jim Reeves records.\" The album contains four songs written or co", "source_type": "random"}

In an uncharacteristic move, Atkins allowed Jennings to use members of his band the Waylors on the recording, something that would rarely be permitted again, much to Waylon's annoyance. Atkins marketed Jennings to the folk-pop audience, calling the album Folk-Country , as folk music was experiencing a renaissance on college campuses throughout the country, but the majority of the songs were mostly country-pop. As Jennings recalled later, \"Folk-Country was Nashville's scheme to snare some of the hootenanny folk audience, which was then starting to cross over to rock...I didn't mind the label; to me, folk music was the original country music, sung by folks, plain and simple.\" The album did contain one Jennings classic: the catchy, up-tempo \"Stop the World (And Let Me Off),\" which was released as a single (peaking at #16) and would remain a part of Jennings' live show for years. Critical reception Folk-Country peaked at #9 on the Billboard country album chart. AllMusic : \" Folk-Country is Waylon's true debut album for the RCA label, and while it is very much embryonic in terms of its revelation of the mature Jennings sound, its roots are clearly audible and the material, while safe, is more than satisfying...The single 'Stop the World (And Let Me Off)' is indicative of the kind of countrypolitan fare Atkins was developing at the label.

Overview The building houses the astrophysics and particle physics sub-departments of the Department of Physics at Oxford University , plus the undergraduate teaching laboratories. It was originally built for the then Department of Nuclear Physics and named the Nuclear Physics Laboratory . From 1988, the building was known as the Nuclear and Astrophysics Laboratory (NAPL) after the (Sub-)Department of Astrophysics moved from the University Observatory in the Science Area . In 2001, the building was renamed as the Denys Wilkinson Building, in honour of the British nuclear physicist Sir Denys Wilkinson (1922\u20132016), who was involved in its original creation. The fan-shaped superstructure built to house a Van de Graaff generator The building is located on the corner of Banbury Road to the west and Keble Road to the south. To the north is the tall Thom Building of Oxford University's Department of Engineering Science, also built in the 1960s. It forms part of the Keble Road Triangle . Attached is a large and distinctive fan-shaped superstructure that was built to house a Van de Graaff generator . Nikolaus Pevsner commented that this marked \"the arrival of the ' New Brutalism ' in Oxford\". Particle accelerators View from Banbury Road View from Keeble Road The building was originally built to host two small (by today's standards) particle accelerators.

Tandem accelerator The first was a vertical folded tandem electrostatic accelerator (see Tandem accelerators , the top being at floor level in the fan-shaped superstructure, the bottom in the basements. Negatively charged ions were introduced at the bottom and would be accelerated towards the large charge (10 million volts) built up by the Van de Graaff generator by electrostatic attraction. At the top, the ions would pass through a thin foil to strip off electrons, and then their trajectory would be bent 180\u00b0 by a large magnetic field. The now positively charged nuclei would then be electrostatically repelled by the same charge, accelerating them back down another vacuum tube. At the bottom the beam pipe exited, the beam was bent 90\u00b0 by another magnet before entering a linear accelerator. This particular accelerator consisted of a pressure vessel, about 40 feet tall, containing an annular lift/elevator platform to enable work to be carried out at different levels inside. Stacked in the centre was the accelerator column, comprising the Van de Graaff generator (a thick, rubber/canvas belt approximately 2 feet wide), the up/down vacuum tubes, and the electron stripper and magnet systems on top. The magnet was powered by a generator driven the by Van de Graaff belt. The column was surrounded by electrostatic discharge protection rings, in case of sparks. The whole column was resting on glass bricks at the bottom, with no lateral supports whatsoever. The pressure vessel was filled with sulphur hexafluoride gas. The storage tank for this was located outside on the eastern side of the building. The gas served as an insulator, allowing higher voltages on the Van de Graaff generator to be run resulting in greater particle energies being attained than if air had been used. It also served as a fire suppressant, in the event of a spark discharge (which, when they did occur, was described as being \"very loud indeed\"). The sulphur", "source_type": "random"}

The sulphur hexafluoride was sourced from a company in Italy, and occasionally shipments of \" bomb ola di gas\" addressed to the \"Nuclear Physics Department\" Oxford would get stuck on the Italian/French border. Linear RF accelerator This was an RF resonant cavity accelerator and would add additional energy to the nuclei. It was located down in a basement. On exiting the accelerator the nuclei would drift to a target station for experiments. The particle energy at the target station was about 22MeV. In the late 1980s, this accelerator was sold to Beijing University. To extract it holes had to be cut through the floor of the covered loading dock located at the north side of the building all the way down to the lowest basement. Nuclear structure physics The accelerators were intended to support research into nuclear structure, a field that was popular at the time of the building's construction. However, it was discovered that the field was extremely complex and progress was slow. The field was overtaken by other fields in nuclear physics, and the accelerators in the Denys Wilkinson Building fell into disuse. Building design The building was designed around conducting particle physics. The bulk of the accelerator infrastructure and experimental target station is in basement levels. The walls of the building at the lower levels are very thick concrete and are laden with boron. This was to keep the natural background radiation count inside the building as low as possible, and not (as was the popular and local civic belief) to keep radiation in.

There was occasionally tension with the local council, which periodically tried to shut down the \"Nuclear Physics Department\" of the university.

John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science The John Adams Institute for Accelerator Science (JAI), named for John Adams (physicist) , is located in the building.

The Entrance Bridge is a road bridge that carries the Central Coast Highway (A49) across the Tuggerah Lakes Entrance Channel and joins the towns of The Entrance and The Entrance North, located on the Central Coast of New South Wales , Australia. The 18-span, 467-metre-long (1,532 ft) concrete girder bridge carries road traffic, as well as a grade-separated pedestrian footpath and cycleway , across Wilfred Barrett Drive as part of the Central Coast Highway. The bridge is maintained by Transport for NSW , an agency of the Government of New South Wales . History Opened for traffic on 15 December 1934, the inaugural Entrance Bridge was originally a wooden single lane bridge with bypass bays at intervals that allowed traffic travelling in the opposite direction to pass. The original bridge was adequate until 1965 as it only served traffic travelling as far as The Entrance North. Around 1955, the Number 11 bus operated by Red Bus Services crashed through a wooden retaining wall and landed in The Entrance Channel after its brakes failed while turning onto The Entrance Bridge. The driver and three passengers were uninjured, although the boat that the bus landed on was heavily damaged. In 1965, Wilfred Barret Drive was opened by the Deputy Premier Pat Hills . The road was named after Councillor Wilfred Barret who was a member of the first Wyong Shire Council . The road continues to be an important link between The Entrance and Toukley , passing through Wyrrabalong National Park . By the end of 1965 the bridge was dangerous and too costly to maintain.

This number is the historical sense of the word and remains the established sense of the word in other European languages. Though displaced by the short scale definition relatively early in US English, it remained the most common sense of the word in Britain until the 1950s and still remains in occasional use there. American English adopted the short scale definition from the French (it enjoyed usage in France at the time, alongside the long-scale definition). The United Kingdom used the long scale until 1974, when the government officially switched to the short scale, but since the 1950s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism. Moreover, in 1941, Winston Churchill remarked: \"For all practical financial purposes a billion represents one thousand millions...\" Other countries use the word billion (or words cognate to it) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion. Milliard , another term for one thousand million, is extremely rare in English, but it is an established term to refer to the short scale billion in many of these countries.

(For details, see Long and short scales \u00a7 Current usage .) History 1000 million Mark Notgeld banknote (1923) of Frankfurt am Main According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word billion was formed in the 16th century (from million and the prefix bi- , \"two\"), meaning the second power of a million (1,000,000 2 = 10 12 ). This long scale definition was similarly applied to trillion , quadrillion and so on. The words were originally Latin, and entered English around the end of the 17th century. Later, French arithmeticians changed the words' meanings, adopting the short scale definition whereby three zeros rather than six were added at each step, so a billion came to denote a thousand million (10 9 ), a trillion became a million million (10 12 ), and so on. This new convention was adopted in the United States in the 19th century, but Britain retained the original long scale use. France, in turn, reverted to the long scale in 1948. In Britain, however, under the influence of American usage, the short scale came to be increasingly used. In 1974, Prime Minister Harold Wilson confirmed that the government would use the word billion only in its short scale meaning (one thousand million). In a written answer to Robin Maxwell-Hyslop MP, who asked whether official usage would conform to the traditional British meaning of a million million, Wilson stated: \"No. The word 'billion' is now used internationally to mean 1,000 million and it would be confusing if British Ministers were to use it in any other sense. I accept that it could still be interpreted in this country as 1 million million and I shall ask my colleagues to ensure that, if they do use it, there should be no ambiguity as to its meaning", "source_type": "random"}

History The KET tower in New Albany, Indiana , broadcasts WKPC-TV and WKMJ-TV to the Louisville area. Creation of the network Interest in educational television in Kentucky existed but was later compared to some other states. In 1953, an educational figure in Louisville told Bill Ladd of The Courier Journal , \"I just hope that Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee don't get so far ahead of us that we can't ever catch up. I hope that Kentucky doesn't start off 48th in educational television.\" While Jefferson County , home to Louisville, began the process to build what became WFPK-TV (now WKPC-TV ) on channel 15 in 1957, and the station signed on the next year, the impetus for what became KET came on July 22, 1959, when O. Leonard Press, the director of the radio department at the University of Kentucky (UK)\u2014owner of educational radio station WBKY , on air since 1940\u2014proposed a statewide educational television network that would include studios at the university, interconnection with other universities, and a transmitter system to deliver educational programs to schools. This service was conceived along the lines of Alabama Educational Television , which had started in 1955 as the first statewide educational network. Press touted a system incorporating WFPK-TV as well as complete coverage of the Commonwealth with the capacity to \"stamp out illiteracy\" and ensure universal teaching of basic school subjects.

He also pushed for the entire network to be built at once to ensure that rural areas, which most needed such a service, were just as well-served as Kentucky's population centers. The network took an important step forward when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) agreed to designate 10 new UHF television channels in the state for non-commercial educational use in August 1961; the original design did not include the transmitters at Elizabethtown or Owenton (as the existing WFPK-TV was included), though it did provide for programs to originate from Lexington, Louisville, or Murray . The plan gained the support of governor Bert T. Combs , and the 1962 Kentucky General Assembly passed a trio of bills to set up the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television, enable the State Board of Education to lease facilities, and allow the state to issue revenue bonds to finance construction. It was hoped to begin KET broadcasts by December 1963, but difficulties mounted, including the refusal of the Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction (MPATI) to sign a contract to furnish programs until schools enrolled in its service. In October 1963, the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television applied for the first construction permits to build the network after clarifying grant rules that initially seemed to make the state government ineligible for funding from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare . However, a two-year setback was experienced in 1964 when the General Assembly\u2014which budgets on a biennial basis\u2014refused to fund construction of the transmitters.

The Elizabethtown transmitter had been added to the proposed network by 1965, when a feature article in the Sunday Herald-Leader noted that Kentucky's plan for transmitter construction had been adopted by other states, notably Georgia. Schools, meanwhile, continued to depend on sources such as MPATI and commercial stations in bordering states, such as WSAZ-TV in Huntington, West Virginia . However, MPATI increased its fees, and WSAZ-TV dropped the mathematics program it was carrying due to scheduling difficulties, affecting 2,700 students in eastern Kentucky. Schools in south-central Kentucky continued to utilize educational programs from WDCN-TV in Nashville, Tennessee ; Glasgow had been among the charter users of WDCN educational programming when it began in 1962, and Bowling Green followed suit in 1964. The 1966 General Assembly budget provided the necessary funds to start work on building KET by including a $359,000 (equivalent to $3,479,170 in 2024) appropriation. Another impetus was given by the Stuart Blazer Foundation, set up by Ashland Oil founder Paul G. Blazer in memory of his deceased son. The foundation began buying and deeding transmitter sites to the state, beginning with the Somerset site in April 1966. Federal matching funds were applied for and received from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Appalachian Regional Commission , while the FCC granted the 12 construction permits later in the year. After awarding WCVN-TV in Covington in late September, the commission awarded the remaining construction permits in November, the largest single award of permits to one applicant in its history.

By May 1968, work on the Lexington and Somerset transmitters had been completed, and KET had announced its initial array of 19 in-school programs, mostly for elementary school students. However, site problems snarled work in Covington. Ashland Oil had provided property in the Taylor Mill area, though the city of Covington also provided sites. However, Taylor Mill met with citizen protest despite being approved by the city council, while sites in Covington would interfere with a new instrument landing system for the Greater Cincinnati Airport . As a result, KET opted to return to Taylor Mill, in spite of opposition whipped up by a local housewife who fretted the facility would be a hazard to aviation and generate interference to reception of other TV stations. The O. Leonard Press years (1968\u20131992) KET finally went on the air for the first time on September 23, 1968, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time (6:30 a.m. Central Time ). The first broadcast started with Governor Louie B. Nunn speaking at the network's dedication ceremony; Nunn himself turned the dial to officially put the network on the air. That first day, eight transmitters opened, at Ashland , Bowling Green , Elizabethtown , Lexington, Madisonville , Morehead , Owenton , Somerset , plus two dependent translators at Hopkinsville and Owensboro . Initially unable to produce its own programs, the original set of courses broadcast by KET were leased or purchased from other producers. The initial broadcast was viewed by about 1,400 schools.

WCVN-TV in Covington began broadcasting on September 8, 1969. Approximately 72 percent of the state's school districts were equipped to utilize KET programs at launch, a figure that grew to 85 to 90 percent within a year. After exclusively providing programs for schools, KET initiated evening broadcasting utilizing programs from National Educational Television on January 6, 1969, a delay that allowed time to train personnel and complete the studio setup. KET transitioned to become a member station of PBS in 1970 upon its creation. That same year, it debuted its first instructional series, the 17-lesson Kentucky Is My Land for use in 7th-grade history classes. After the initial twelve-transmitter network was completed, three more stations were added between 1970 and 1980. Network reception turned out to be poor in the Louisville area, prompting the network to launch WKMJ-TV (channel 68) on August 31, 1970. In Paducah , unsuccessful commercial station WDXR-TV (channel 29) was donated to the network; it was rebuilt and returned as WKPD in 1979, and a full-power Owensboro transmitter, WKOH-TV (channel 31), started operating on February 14, 1980.

KET began to receive PBS programming via satellite on April 15, 1978. During the 1970s, KET also matured in the area of programming and structure. Friends of KET, a non-profit volunteer organization supporting KET's fundraising, was incorporated in 1971. Three years later, Comment on Kentucky , one of KET's flagship public affairs shows, debuted. In March 1975, KET broadcast the network's first telethon, dubbed Festival '75 , a 10-day-long programming schedule that temporarily converted the network to an alternative channel to commercial outlets; this was done in hopes of expanding regular programming to a seven-day basis. Three months later, KET began broadcasting seven days a week with the debut of a Saturday schedule. In 1978, KET initiated nightly coverage during the sessions of the Kentucky General Assembly. In expanding its public affairs remit, KET had to deal with political controversy, notably around its legislative coverage. These increased public affairs and other programs did not detract from KET's educational mission. By 1977, 75 percent of Kentucky schools used KET programming, primarily in elementary classes, including 99.3 percent of the state's special needs students. The network produced a GED adult education series sold to stations in 25 states and the Department of Defense . The nationally regarded GED program in several iterations has continued to be a part of KET.

The network was in part insulated by a timing quirk: federal construction credits from the new facilities in Paducah and Owensboro accrued to KET in 1980 and 1981 and offset most of the state's budget cuts. Despite this environment, Press continued to push for ambitious expansion. KET etc. began broadcasting on Lexington's new cable system in 1981 with adult education programs as well as replays of KET programming. In order to make the service more widely available in Lexington and statewide on translators, KET applied for the then-open commercial channel 62 in the area, but after three commercial groups also sought the channel, KET withdrew its proposal in June 1982. Despite budget cuts, Press was reluctant to cede to commercializing inroads. KET did not air regular annual pledge drives , branded as Telefund , until March 1981, and underwriting announcements were modest and did not use company logos. I think of us as an educational institution that uses television as its method of reaching its clientele. Our business is education, not broadcasting.

The first Star Channels course, on statistics and probability, was taught in January 1989 to 24 Kentucky high schools and another 41 high schools in 16 states. The program was then rolled out statewide in the wake of the Kentucky Supreme Court finding the state's education system unconstitutional. Star Channels attracted international attention, including delegations from China and Kuwait. In 1990, the General Assembly established the KET Fund for Independent Productions, a grant program to support the development of independent films in Kentucky. Press announced his retirement from KET effective June 30, 1992. He would be replaced by Virginia Gaines Fox of Campbellsville , whom Press had hired to KET at the network's launch in 1968. By his retirement, Press had been honored as national public television manager of the year and had also served as chair of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and the PBS board of directors and the vice chair of the National Association of Public Television Stations. That October, KET opened a 67,000-square-foot (6,200 m 2 ) expansion of its Lexington facility, which was dedicated as the O. Leonard Press Telecommunications Center in this honor.

On July 1, 1997, KET's main programming moved to WKPC-TV. WKMJ-TV simultaneously suspended operations for a transmitter overhaul; it returned a month later at increased power, carrying a new service called KET2, which was designed with the Louisville metropolitan area in mind and initially featured additional children's programs, adult education programming and local productions. Outside of Louisville, KET2 was seen on cable systems statewide, and it replaced the former KET Etc. channel in Lexington. The state network also added to its schedule several programs that WKPC-TV had aired in the Louisville area but not KET in the rest of the state. KET was the first Kentucky television station to begin digital broadcasts, with WKPC-DT in Louisville being activated on August 19, 1999, by governor Paul E.

The term may refer to several different poetic meters, the older of which are quantitative and used chiefly in classical ( Ancient Greek and Latin ) poetry, and the newer of which are syllabic or accentual-syllabic and used in medieval and modern poetry. Classical In classical poetry, \"hendecasyllable\" or \"hendecasyllabic\" may refer to any of three distinct 11-syllable Aeolic meters, used first in Ancient Greece and later, with little modification, by Roman poets. Aeolic meters are characterized by an Aeolic base \u00d7 \u00d7 followed by a choriamb \u2013 u u \u2013 ; where \u2013 = a long syllable, u = a short syllable, and \u00d7 = an anceps , that is, a syllable either long or short. The three Aeolic hendecasyllables (with base and choriamb in bold) are: Phalaecian hendecasyllable ( Latin : hendecasyllabus phalaecius ): \u00d7 \u00d7 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 This line is named after Phalaecus , a minor Hellenistic poet who used it in epigrams; though he did not invent it, since it had earlier been used by Sappho and Anacreon . The Phalaecian hendecasyllable was a favorite of Catullus ; it was also very frequently used by Martial . An example from Catullus is the first poem in his collection, given below. The translation attempts to convey some sense of the rhythm, substituting English stress for Latin length. Cui d\u014dn\u014d lepidum novum libellum \u0101rid\u0101 modo p\u016bmic(e) expol\u012btum?

The aeolic base (i.e., the first two syllables of the line) with \u2013 \u2013 is by far the most common in Catullus, and in later poets such as Statius and Martial was the only one used, but occasionally Catullus uses u \u2013 or \u2013 u as in lines 2 and 4 above. There is usually a caesura in the line after the 5th or 6th syllable. In the first part of his poetry collection, Catullus uses the Phalaecian hendecasyllable as given above in 41 poems. In addition, in two of his poems (55 and 58b) Catullus uses a variation of the metre, in which the 4th and 5th syllables can sometimes be contracted into a single long syllable. In poem 55 there are twelve decasyllables and ten normal lines: \u014cr\u0101mus, s\u012b forte non molestum (e)st, d\u0113m\u014dnstr\u0113s ubi sint tuae tenebrae... \u2014Catullus: \" Catullus 55 \", lines 1-2 Translation: We beg, if perhaps it is not a nuisance, that you should show us where your lair is...

Italian The hendecasyllable ( Italian : endecasillabo ) is the principal metre in Italian poetry . Its defining feature is a constant stress on the tenth syllable, so that the number of syllables in the verse may vary, equaling eleven in the usual case where the final word is stressed on the penultimate syllable. The verse also has a stress preceding the caesura , on either the fourth or sixth syllable. The first case is called endecasillabo a minore , or lesser hendecasyllable, and has the first hemistich equivalent to a quinario ; the second is called endecasillabo a maiore , or greater hendecasyllable, and has a settenario as the first hemistich. There is a strong tendency for hendecasyllabic lines to end with feminine rhymes (causing the total number of syllables to be eleven, hence the name), but ten-syllable lines ( \"Ci\u00f2 che 'n grembo a Benaco star non pu\u00f2\" ) and twelve-syllable lines ( \"Ergasto mio, perch\u00e9 solingo e tacito\" ) are encountered as well. Lines of ten or twelve syllables are more common in rhymed verse; versi sciolti , which rely more heavily on a pleasant rhythm for effect, tend toward a stricter eleven-s", "source_type": "random"}

Lines of ten or twelve syllables are more common in rhymed verse; versi sciolti , which rely more heavily on a pleasant rhythm for effect, tend toward a stricter eleven-syllable format. As a novelty, lines longer than twelve syllables can be created by the use of certain verb forms and affixed enclitic pronouns ( \"Ottima \u00e8 l'acqua; ma le piante abbeverinosene.\" ). Additional accents beyond the two mandatory ones provide rhythmic variation and allow the poet to express thematic effects. A line in which accents fall consistently on even-numbered syllables ( \"Al c\u00f2r gent\u00ecl remp\u00e0ira s\u00e8mpre am\u00f3re\" ) is called iambic ( giambico ) and may be a greater or lesser hendecasyllable. This line is the simplest, commonest and most musical but may become repetitive, especially in longer works. Lesser hendecasyllables often have an accent on the seventh syllable ( \"f\u00e0tta di gi\u00f2co in fig\u00f9ra d'am\u00f3re\" ). Such a line is called dactylic ( dattilico ) and its less pronounced rhythm is considered particularly appropriate for representing dialogue. Another kind of greater hendecasyllable has an accent on the third syllable ( \"Se Merc\u00e9 fosse am\u00ecca a' miei dis\u00ecri\" ) and is known as anapestic ( anapestico ). This sort of line has a crescendo effect and gives the poem a sense of speed and fluidity. It is considered improper for the lesser hendecasyllable to use a word accented on its antepenultimate syllable ( parola sdrucciola ) for its mid-line stress.

A line like \"Pi\u00f9 non sfav\u00ecllano quegli \u00f2cchi n\u00e9ri\" , which delays the caesura until after the sixth syllable, is not considered a valid hendecasyllable. Most classical Italian poems are composed in hendecasyllables, including the major works of Dante , Francesco Petrarca , Ludovico Ariosto , and Torquato Tasso . The rhyme systems used include terza rima , ottava , sonnet and canzone , and some verse forms use a mixture of hendecasyllables and shorter lines. From the early 16th century onward, hendecasyllables are often used without a strict system, with few or no rhymes, both in poetry and in drama. This is known as verso sciolto . An early example is Le Api (\"the bees\") by Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai , written around 1517 and published in 1525 (with formal equivalent paraphrase which mirrors the original's syllabic counts, varied caesurae, and line- and hemistich-final stress profiles): Mentr'era per cantare i vostri doni Con alte rime, o Verginette caste, Vaghe Angelette delle erbose rive, Preso dal sonno, in sul spuntar dell'Alba M'apparve un coro della vostra gente, E dalla lingua, onde s'accoglie il mele, Sciolsono in chiara voce este parole: O spirto amico, che dopo mill'anni, E cinque cento, rinovar ti piace E le nostre fatiche, e i nostri studi, Fuggi le rime, e'l rimbombar sonoro. \u2014Rucellai", "source_type": "random"}

Sir Richard Fanshawe In Portuguese, the hendecasyllable meter is often called \"decasyllable\" ( decass\u00edlabo ), even when the work in question uses overwhelmingly feminine rhymes (as is the case with the Lusiads ). This is due to Portuguese prosody considering verses to end at the last stressed syllable, thus the aforementioned verses are effectively decasyllabic according to Portuguese scansion.

The administrative capital is Bolta\u00f1a and the economic capital is A\u00ednsa . History Sobrarbe was one of the Christian principalities of the Marca Hispanica , with obscure origins. Legend says there was a Kingdom of Sobrarbe , where a cross appeared upon a tree ( Latin : Supra Arbore ). It became part of the County of Aragon , but in the early 9th century was held for five years by Amrus ibn Yusuf , the governor of Zaragoza , retaken after his death. Sobrarbe was joined to the County of Ribagorza in the early 10th century through the marriage of Bernard I of Ribagorza to Toda Gal\u00edndez of Aragon, daughter of Galindo Azn\u00e1rez II . However, in the late 10th and early 11th century, a series of incursions from the south left it disorganized and depopulated, and for a time it fell back under Muslim control.

Located in Montgomery County, Maryland , the museum's primary mission is to preserve and interpret the history of the electric street and interurban railways of the National Capital region. History NCTM was incorporated on January 4, 1961, as the National Capital Historical Museum of Transportation, Inc. Progress was slow at first, but the museum eventually combined efforts and streetcar collections with a group from Baltimore . The organization found its first home in Lake Roland Park in Baltimore, Maryland . After efforts were thwarted by adjacent property owners, the group divided the collections in 1966. National Capital Trolley Museum moved to its present site in Colesville, Maryland , while the Baltimore Streetcar Museum was formed to focus on Baltimore transit. The site was provided by Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission , and DC Transit leased trolleys for a nominal cost. The organization raised $20,000 to build a car barn. Groundbreaking of the Colesville site began on November 20, 1965. NCTM's original intention was to operate streetcars owned by DC Transit president O. Roy Chalk , but it was not until 1970 that Chalk donated several historic Washington streetcars. In the interim, the museum acquired a small fleet of European trams and a car from Johnstown, Pennsylvania .

On Thursdays and Fridays each spring and fall, the museum hosts school field trips by advance reservation. Special summer programs are offered on Thursday and Friday from June 15 to August 15 with age-appropriate activities. Membership and funding Members and friends support the museum with dues, donations and volunteer service. The museum receives most of its money from admission fees and revenues from its gift shop.

In 1987, cars 1053 and 766 were severely damaged in a collision. One of the worst disasters to ever befall a North American trolley museum occurred at NCTM on September 28, 2003, when one of the two carbarns at the museum's former site burned down. Eight pieces of equipment, comprising about half of the museum's operating fleet and one-third of its total collection of street cars, were destroyed. Washington cars lost included 0509, 1053, 07, and 026. Johnstown 352, Graz 120, and Vienna 6062 and 7802 were also destroyed. The cause of the fire was not definitely determined, though the fire inspector did conclude that it was an accidental fire and not a case of arson. Some of the cars lost, such as 1053 and 07, were the only preserved examples of their designs, while others have examples preserved elsewhere. Immediately following the fire, the museum resumed operations with the remaining cars. Since the fire, the museum has purchased streetcars from, or traded with, other museums to replace those lost.

The population was 1,091 at the 2020 Census . Boley was incorporated in 1905 as a predominantly Black pioneer town with persons having Native American ancestry among its citizens. Of the 50 identifiable Black towns established in Oklahoma between 1865 to 1920, Boley is one of only 13 still in existence. Boley is currently home to barbeque equipment maker, Smokaroma, Inc, and the John Lilley Correctional Center.

Currently Boley hosts The Annual Boley Rodeo & Bar-B-Que Festival. History Background Creek Freedmen in the Indian Territory , who were the descendants of Black slaves held by the Creek tribe and allotted 160 acres of land each as a result of the Dawes Commission , set up independent townships, of which Boley was one. The town was established on land owned by Abigail Barnett, the daughter of a Creek Freedman. As Boley and its surrounding area already possessed a well-established and independent Black community, many Black Southerners who eventually emigrated there perceived the town as a safe haven from the South's limited economic opportunities , white supremacist paramilitaries (e.g. White League , Red Shirts , and the Ku Klux Klan ), and discriminatory laws re-imposed at the collapse of Reconstruction .

Lake Moore, a white speculator, contributed the initial $500 investment needed to lease Barnett's land for five years. Another influential figure was the town's namesake, J. B. Boley, a white official of the Fort Smith & Western Railroad who oversaw the development of a depot in the middle of Boley. After being approved for a post office two months prior in July, the town officially opened for settlement on September 26, 1903. One of the most influential early settlers in Boley was David J. Turner, a businessman who would, besides serving as town mayor and councilman on multiple occasions, also work as a bank president and pharmacist. Another important settler was Hilliard Taylor, who developed a thriving cotton ginning business. The development of the railroad brought traffic and allowed agricultural land to be more profitably used as a townsite. Property owned by the Barnett family, among other Creek Freedmen , was midway between Paden and Castle , and ideal for a station stop. With the approval of the railroad management, Boley, Creek Nation , Indian Territory was incorporated in 1905. During the early part of the 20th century, Boley became a regional business hub and one of the wealthiest Black towns in the US. It boasted two banks, including the first nationally-chartered Black-owned bank, three cotton gins, its own electric company, a movie theater, hotels, and multiple legal and dentistry practices.

It promoted the town to African Americans in the American South, and specialized in reporting Southern news. In its debut issue, the Progress coined Boley the \"Haven of the Negro.\" An annual subscription initially cost $1. Under the editorship of Oniel H. Bradley, the motto of the Progress was \"All Men Up, Not Some Down.\" Bradley promoted an \"emancipationist vision\" of Boley, portraying the town as a place where Black southerners could escape discrimination and finally enjoy a real freedom to serve as \"business men, farmers, merchants, and wage workers,\" free from the antagonism of hostile white mobs . Additionally, Bradley believed that flourishing and well-governed black towns like Boley would help alleviate the nation's \"racial problem\" and counter negative stereotypes of Black Americans . Subscribers across the South were informed about Boley's local economy, population growth, political elections, investment opportunities, and more.

As a result of his promotional efforts, Bradley attracted Black settlers from diverse social backgrounds, ranging from farmers to college-educated professionals. In the fall of 1905, Bradley's Progress persuaded Joe P. Thompson, a devout reader from Rusk, Texas , to organize an emigration of approximately fifty Black families from his community to the area around Boley. Reflecting upon Boley's ballooning growth in its initial years, early settler Hallie Smith Jones remarked that \"people came to Boley by train loads. In some instances eight and ten families would alight from the same train. Their luggage would fill the depot platform and would be piled six and seven feet high.\" Womanhood in Boley Three unidentified women in Boley c. 1918 . Black women served many valuable roles within the town, such as entrepreneurs, farmers, schoolteachers, tours guides for prospective settlers, and, of course, as loyal wives and mothers rearing future generations of Black children. Single-sex (women-exclusive) organizations committed to progressive principles sprouted up in Boley. For instance, the Ladies Industrial Club, founded in October 1908, was involved in various community service projects, playing a significant role in the creation of the town's public library. California M. Taylor, who was renowned for her work as a notary public and later as a pharmacist, was an influential leader in Boley's NAACP branch.

George Washington Carver once called Boley \"the most progressive black town in the U.S.\" Boley became notorious for its sundown town signage, subverting whites-only norms, for reading, \"White man, don't let the sun set on you here.\" The sign was removed by federal agents in 1924.

During the night of the predicted engagement, the white citizens of Okemah developed an elaborate defense system and prepared for battle. However, no fighting ever occurred, presumably because Boley's black community had hunkered down themselves to protect their town. In October 1911, a \"State Convention of Black Men and Women\" was hosted in Boley, organized by local black clergymen . The conservative, central message of the meeting was to advocate to neighboring white communities the specific distinction between Blacks who possess \"respectable standing in his community\" and those who embody the \"vicious element of the race.\" In an attempt to sooth racial tensions and prevent future mob violence, the convention sought to convince white audiences that the law-abiding Black middle-class would be willing to join arms with their white neighbors in condemning the lowly Black \"criminal.\" 1932 bank raid of Pretty Boy Floyd's gang David Turner standing on the steps of the Farmers and Merchants Bank, the first Black-owned bank with a national charter in the U.S. In November 1932, three members belonging to the gang of the notorious outlaw Pretty Boy Floyd attempted to rob Boley's Farmers and Merchants Bank, but were thwarted by the town's citizens.

While Birdwell and Patterson emptied the register of all cash, the bank's president, David Turner, who was on duty at the time, sounded the alarm to alert the townspeople. Herbert C.

Birdwell managed to fire multiple shots into Turner before collapsing onto the bank's floor. However, the chronology of what transpired inside the bank is not completely clear, as some accounts contend that an infuriated Birdwell shot Turner after discovering that he had pulled the alarm, which then caused McCormick to open fire on Birdwell. Patterson shuffled out of the bank and attempted to flee to the getaway vehicle, but he had now come face-to-face with Boley's armed citizenry, who had grabbed whatever weapons they could find, including guns, screwdrivers, and tools. Though Patterson was \"riddled with bullets,\" he miraculously survived and was arrested by Boley sheriff Joseph Langston McCormick, the brother of the bank worker who had shot Birdwell. Glass, hearing the gunfire, had exited the car and made his way towards the bank to help his fellow bandits, but upon seeing Patterson collapse from his wounds, desperately scrambled back towards the vehicle.

Now the Governor of Oklahoma , William H. Murray , the very same man who sought to destroy the independence of Black-towns like Boley decades prior, sent his official condolences; thousands of people from around the state went to Boley to attend Turner's funeral. The Farmers and Merchants Bank was closed shortly thereafter. As historian William Savage Jr. notes, several conflicting narratives of the robbery attempt had unfortunately sprung up in the ensuing decades, demonstrating the shortcomings of relying upon human recollection . The most egregious differences in accounts relate to how Birdwell died (including how many times he was shot and by whom) and the details about what specific gun Herbert McCormick used. Decline Boley's development paralleled that of the Fort Smith & Western Railway , which went bankrupt during the Great Depression and ceased operations in 1939. Additionally, Boley's economy was heavily dependent on cotton farming , which often created long-lasting debt for its producers and, from the 1920s, suffered from recurrent boll weevil infestations. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s also encouraged families to move out of Boley.

He joined Queen Insurance at the age of 14 and was transferred to Winnipeg in 1902. He became local manager of the renamed Royal Insurance office in Toronto in 1906.

Quinn and Livingstone knew each other from managing the Toronto Amateur Athletic Club 's ice hockey team in previous years. In 1918, Livingstone and Quinn would team up against the owners of the NHA, now operating as the National Hockey League (NHL). Together, they attempted to overthrow the NHL and resurrect the NHA but were unsuccessful as the rinks were controlled by the NHL or its partners. Quinn bought an option for the dormant Quebec city franchise of the NHA/NHL and was named a director of the NHL. However, the franchise option was bought only to provide a Quebec club for the resurrected NHA league or a new league. When the NHA plan failed and Quinn did not commit to operating the team in the NHL, the franchise was transferred to Mike Quinn (no relation) of Quebec City. The franchise operated as the Quebec Athletics in the 1919\u201320 season and then moved to Hamilton, Ontario . In 1920, Quinn became managing director of the Arena Gardens. In this position, he along with Livingstone attempted again to form a new league, one that would have two teams in Toronto, one in Hamilton and one possibly in the United States; either in Boston, Cleveland or Detroit. However, the Arena was placed into bankruptcy and Quinn was replaced by a receiver. The NHL placed the Quebec team in Hamilton to counter the threat.

He served as the secretary for Colonial Affairs and head of the Imperial Colonial Office from May 1907 to 9 June 1910, and as the minister of Finance and vice-chancellor of Germany from 17 April to 20 June 1919. Background and banking career Born in Darmstadt in the Grand Duchy of Hesse , Bernhard Dernburg was the son of publisher and politician Friedrich Dernburg (1833\u20131911), a member of the National Liberal Party , belonging to a distinguished Jewish family. Friedrich Dernburg had converted to Lutheranism and married Luise Stahl, the daughter of a Lutheran minister. Bernhard Dernburg was a Lutheran . He made a career in banking, including at the Deutsche Bank , and became Director of Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft in 1889. He subsequently joined the management of the Darmst\u00e4dter Bank . In 1901, he founded the Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks- und H\u00fctten-AG together with Hugo Stinnes , which became one of the largest companies in its field. He served as a board member of a number of large industrial companies. Political career Bernhard Dernburg addressing a street demonstration in 1919 In 1906, Dernburg entered politics as Prussian Representative at the Federal Council .

The colonial administration was racked with scandals, and the much-touted economic benefits of colonisation were yet to be seen. It was felt that putting an energetic and successful businessman in charge of the colonies might resolve some of these problems, although the bureaucrats in Berlin and in the colonies took a dim view of Dernburg's qualifications. Colonial matters played a prominent role in the German election of January 1907 . Dernburg campaigned for a policy of rational economic development of the colonies, based upon the construction of railways. He was one of the first to realise that the indigenous population of the colonies was a resource which Germany had neglected, and he was fond of stating that \"The native is the most valuable asset in our colonies.\" Chancellor B\u00fclow was victorious in the election, and in May 1907 he established a separate Colonial Office, appointing Dernburg as first secretary-of-state for the colonies. From July to October 1907 Dernburg undertook a study-tour to East Africa . Here the reforming governor, Albrecht von Rechenberg , organised a carefully choreographed programme which convinced Dernburg that the future of the colony lay in the promotion of African small-holder agriculture, rather than large European-owned plantations. Railway development was another crucial aspect of this programme, to allow produce to be exported from the interior to the coastal ports. From May to August 1908 Dernburg undertook a tour of German Southwest Africa (now Namibia), where he was more conciliatory in his dealings with the white population than he had been in East Africa. Late in 1909 he went to the United States, to investigate the possibilities of improving cotton production in the German colonies.

Together with fellow university students, Atrash became a founding member of the Ba'ath Party and its Syrian regional branch in 1947. During the presidency of Adib Shishakli (1951\u201354), he became an anti-government activist and was imprisoned twice, only to be released in an unsuccessful attempt by Shishakli to gain the support of Atrash's father, Sultan . In the year Shishakli was overthrown, Atrash was elected to parliament and turned down an offer to serve in Said al-Ghazzi 's government. During the period of the United Arab Republic (1958\u201361), Atrash became a strong supporter of Egyptian president and pan-Arab leader Gamal Abdel Nasser . He opposed Syria's secession from the UAR and turned down offers to serve in successive separatist governments in protest. When the Ba'ath Party gained power in the 1963 coup , Atrash became Minister of Social Affairs and in 1965 the head of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). A second coup by left-wing Ba'athist officers resulted in a split within the party between the coup officers led by the Military Committee and the founders led by Michel Aflaq , with Atrash being an ardent supporter of the latter. He was subsequently imprisoned, but released in the aftermath of Syria's defeat in the 1967 War with Israel .

At the time, the Jabal al-Druze area constituted an autonomous zone (existing between 1922 and 1936) within the French Mandate of Syria (established in 1920). Tensions between the Druze and the French authorities stemmed from a number of reasons, particularly what the local Druze leaders saw as French encroachment into their domestic affairs and self-governance. The revolt began in the summer of 1925 and had soon spread throughout Syria, ending with the military defeat of Syrian rebels in 1927 and the self-imposed exile of Sultan to Transjordan after the Mandatory authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. He returned in 1937 after being pardoned by the authorities. It was in Transjordan, and later in Damascus and Beirut, that Mansur completed his primary and secondary education. In 1946, Mansur went to study at the American University in Beirut (AUB), and graduated in 1948 with a BA in political science. In 1951, he attained a law degree from the Sorbonne University .

Atrash participated in anti-Shishakli activity, including throwing explosives at Shishakli's residence in 1952, an action which resulted in Atrash's arrest. In 1953 Shishakli launched a crackdown on the Druze community, claiming they were being funded by Hashemite -ruled Jordan and Iraq to establish a Hashemite government in Syria. Jabal al-Druze was bombarded by government forces and Atrash's father Sultan was put under house arrest for his vocal criticism of Shishakli. After Shishakli came into conflict with the Ba'athists that year as a result of the former's authoritarian manner of governance, Atrash moved to Homs , a hotbed of opposition to Shishakli's rule, where he helped coordinate the supply of arms to insurgents in Jabal al-Druze.

In response to Atrash's second release from prison, Sultan said \"I didn't ask Shishakli for the freedom of my son. I asked him for the freedom of my country.\" According to Moubayed, Atrash's anti-government activities significantly contributed to Shishakli's resignation and departure from Syria in February 1954 amid the countrywide unrest. In the first post-Shishakli democratic election later that year, Atrash was elected to parliament.

His seclusion from Syrian politics ended after the Military Committee of the Ba'ath Party took power in a coup d'\u00e9tat on 8 March 1963. The Military Committee's stated goal was to reestablish a pan-Arab state; a goal Atrash shared. He was appointed Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in Salah al-Din al-Bitar 's first government, and became a member of the Presidential Council , an organ responsible for running day-to-day state affairs. In February 1964 Atrash was elected to the 12-member Ba'ath Party National Command , which was nominally the highest policy-making body of the party. Differences between Bitar and the Regional Command had developed in 1964, with the latter viewing Bitar's cabinet as being right-leaning and soft on \"reactionary\" elements within Syria in the aftermath of Hama uprising in April of that year by the Muslim Brotherhood . President Amin al-Hafiz had been prime minister at the time of the unrest and stepped down in response to countrywide strikes and demonstrations in protest at the severity of the uprising's suppression.

On 1 September 1965 Atrash was appointed Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), but acquired little de facto power because of the Military Committee's overarching control, with Atrash later remarking \"the officers let us do the talking although, as we later discovered, they had agreed beforehand ... what the decisions would be.\" The RCC played the role of parliament and Atrash was its speaker. In December tensions between the National Command (loyal to Aflaq and Bitar) and the Regional Command (loyal to Jadid and backed by the military) grew worse as elements of the former attempted to align with Military Committee member Muhammad Umran in an effort to split the military's support (and according to Syria expert Itamar Rabinovich , the Alawite officers' solid backing) of Jadid. However, Atrash, along with Munif al-Razzaz of Jordan and Jubran al-Majdalani and Ali al-Khalil of Lebanon , was a part of the group in the National Command that opposed confrontation with the Regional Command, citing the National Command's lack of military support and political power as well as the fundamental weakness of an alliance with Umran and Amin al-Hafiz.

The Jadid government's coming to power resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq . Atrash, a partisan of Aflaq, was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup. The new defense minister and future president Hafez al-Assad later paid him a visit to discuss Syria's political situation and check on his health. On 9 June 1967, when the Israeli Army occupied the Golan Heights during the Six-Day War , Atrash and other Aflaq loyalists were released from their detention. Atrash later remarked that \"It was not agreeable to know that we owed our freedom to defeat.\" In collaboration with dissenting Ba'athist officer Salim Hatum , Atrash attempted to overthrow Jadid's government in 1967, but failed.

Atrash had a son named Tha'er and a daughter named Rim. Because Atrash's wife was not from the Druze community, the marriage caused a temporary schism between Atrash and his father. Eventually the two bridged their differences. Following Sultan's death in 1982, Mansur gained the latter's role as the major spokesman for the al-Atrash clan.

Despite his steady career, with wins on four continents, including Asia, Baker-Finch was not generally counted as a member of the elite group of international golfers. When he won the 1991 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale, closing with a 64-66 to beat Mike Harwood by two strokes, he was considered a surprise champion. He had three other runner-up finishes that year as well and again qualified for the Tour Championship with a 13th-place finish on the money list. He ranked briefly in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking that year. Baker-Finch had a 10-year exemption from the PGA Tour for his Open Championship win, leaving him exempt until 2001. He achieved a runner-up finish in The Players Championship in 1992, but otherwise never came close to contending on the PGA Tour again. He picked up wins in Australia in 1992 and 1993 but his form then went into a steep and accelerating decline. He began to lose confidence in his game and tinkered with his swing often. His last top-10 finish on the PGA Tour was a tie for 10th in the 1994 Masters Tournament . Baker-Finch then famously suffered a complete collapse of his game. The problems were often psychological: he would hit shots flawlessly on the practice range, and then go to the first tee and hit a weak drive into the wrong fairway. In the 1995 Open Championship at St Andrews , he notoriously hooked his first round tee shot at the first out-of-bounds on the left side of the fairway shared with the 18th, with attention focused on him as his playing partner was Arnold Palmer , competing in his final Open. In 1995 and 1996 he missed the cut, withdrew", "source_type": "random"}

In 1995 and 1996 he missed the cut, withdrew after one round or was disqualified in all 29 PGA Tour events that he entered. Baker-Finch later said: \"I lost my confidence. I got to the point where I didn't even want to be out on the golf course because I was playing so poorly. I would try my hardest but when I came out to play, I managed to find a way to miss the cut time and time again. It became a habit.\" After shooting a 92 in the first round of the 1997 Open at Royal Troon , an extraordinarily bad score by tournament professional standards, Baker-Finch admitted that he cried in the locker room that afternoon. He withdrew from the championship after one round and retired from tournament golf. In 2013, in a return to tournament form, Baker-Finch together with Bart Bryant won the age 60 to 69 exhibition portion of the Champions Tour Legends of Golf tournament. Broadcasting career After his game deserted him, Baker-Finch turned his interests to careers in broadcasting and golf course design and management. He was hired by ESPN and ABC Sports to comment on golf tournaments in 1998, and did so until 2006. During this time, Baker-Finch served as the lead analyst for ESPN and as a hole announcer for ABC, though on many occasions he filled in as ABC's lead analyst. In 2007, he was hired by CBS Sports as a hole announcer, a position he held until his retirement on August 3, 2025.

The Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft ( German: , German Oriental Society ), abbreviated DMG , is a scholarly organization dedicated to Oriental studies , that is, to the study of the languages and cultures of the Near East and the Far East , the broader Orient , Asia , Oceania , and Africa . The DMG was established on 2 October 1845 in Leipzig by leading Oriental scholars from Germany, as well as members of other Orientalist societies such as the Asiatic Societies in Paris (the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique ), London (the Royal Asiatic Society ), and Calcutta (the Asiatic Society ). It was founded \"to promote all aspects of the knowledge of Asia and of the countries closely related to it in every aspect, and to propagate participation of this in wider circles. Hence the Society will deal not only with oriental literature ( morgenl\u00e4ndische Literatur ) but also with the history of these countries and the research of their situation both earlier and more recent times.\" The DMG has traditionally concentrated on the \"knowledge of languages, literatures, history, religions and philosophies, forms of law and society, archaeology, and the art and material culture of the people living in these areas\". In recent years, its scope has expanded to include sociology and political science as well. The academic disciplines represented in the DMG include the following: Ancient Near Eastern studies , Semitic languages , Jewish studies , Arabic studies , Islamic studies , the study of Oriental Christianity , Persian studies and Iranian studies , Indology , Turkish studies , Central Asian studies , Indo-European studies , Mongolian studies , Tibetan studies , Sinology , Japanese studies , Southeast Asian studies , and African studies .
